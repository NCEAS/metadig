## Run A Check on an Incomplete Document

This is a potential use case.

### Goal

Allow Checks to be run on incomplete documents.

### Summary

Can we use the Engine to give live feedback to users as they are authoring
metadata content? Say the user enters a title and what they've entered would
get them a FAILURE on a Check. If we don't provide a way to run Checks on
incomplete documents, the user would have to finish their form submission and
only then could their document be checked. Live feedback, given at the time of
authoring their content, seems like it may improve the user experience and
result in higher-quality metadata content.
