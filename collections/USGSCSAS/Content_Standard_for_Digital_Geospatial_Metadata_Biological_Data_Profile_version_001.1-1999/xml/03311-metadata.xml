      <abstract>MARIS is an internet-based information sharing network that allows multiple states to provide a common set of variables via a single web interface.  MARIS is not a ?dataset? but rather links specific content of multiple states? datasets.  MARIS does not capture all of the information from a state?s aquatic dataset ? only a subset of data collected as part of aquatic species sampling surveys. 

The MARIS structure was developed by a consortium of state fish and wildlife agencies and implemented through contracts with various universities.  Federal agency partners have provided the core funding for developing and implementing MARIS as well as broad guidance on the content of the system.</abstract>
      <purpose>MARIS was initially developed to serve a need for states to provide data in response to data requests from multiple federal agencies.  However, it has evolved to provide a potentially valuable tool for state agencies to provide data in response to numerous data inquiries from members of the public or nongovernmental organizations.  The initial focus of MARIS was to provide data elements related to the ?status and trends? of fisheries, but this thinking has evolved into a broader utility of the data including serving as a conduit for states to contribute data for the National Fish Habitat Action Plan (NFHAP). dataset is a subset of the Multistate Aquatic Resource Information System (MARIS) dataset.

      <supplinf>Sampling within each state dataset could have been done as a ?Community Sample? in which all species at a site were collected/cataloged, or sampling could have been done as ?targeted? sample where only a certain species or species group was sampled.  Within the dataset, each sample is noted as to whether it was a community or targeted sample.  If it was a targeted sample, the targeted species or species group is noted.  This dataset is standardized to MARIS formatting requirements and therefor may not include all variables from its original dataset.  Please use the listed metadata contact to inquire about the availability of additional variables.</supplinf>

          <formcont>The Multistate Aquatic Resources Information System (MARIS) is a cooperative effort between state and federal agencies to share fisheries information collected as part of ongoing sampling programs. This layer depicts every fish and/or water quality sampling location submitted by participating MARIS states. Each point is attributed with the originator (who submitted the data), the name of the dataset (multiple datasets may have been submitted for each originator), and a unique "water ID" which has been generated by the MARIS project for each sampling point. The "maris_water_id" field can be used to link each sampling point with fish and/or water quality data for each point, which is available as summarized tables within this map service. See the service descriptions for each table for more information. Note that the entire MARIS database is also available for download at marisdata.org.</formcont>

This table was created by the MARIS project based on data submitted by the MARIS partners. The table, which contains nearly one million records, lists every species which was found at each sampling location. Along with the name of the species, other attributes such as sample date and gear type are included with each record. The "maris_water_id" field can be used to link each record in this table to the "MARIS Survey Points" layer which is part of this map service. Users should note that this table contains only selected fields from the MARIS database. Other fields, such as the quantity of each fish collected at each location, population estimates, CPUE, etc are also available in MARIS but are not included in this table.
