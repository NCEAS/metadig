      <abstract>Overall, the field methods used by the Kansas Natural Heritage Inventory in sampling and classifying the vegetation followed the methodology outlined by the USGS-BRD/NPS Vegetation Mapping Program and the NVC (Grossman et al. 1994, Grossman et al. 1998).  The application of these methods to Homestead National Monument of America is outlined below.

Vegetation data were collected in characteristic plots by KBS in July 2008 and additional plot information was acquired from the Heartland Inventory and Monitoring Network. Characteristic plots were located in areas that were visually representative of the preliminary vegetation categories.  Plots were 100 m2 in area, and GPS coordinates were recorded with a Garmin receiver.  To maintain consistency with other projects in Kansas, plots were square.  The accuracy for all of the recorded points ranged from 1-7 meters in horizontal accuracy, as recorded by the GPS receiver.  Thirteen plots were sampled in the preliminary vegetation type "Restored Prairie," and three plots were sampled in the preliminary vegetation type "Central Tallgrass Prairie."

The survey form used for characteristic plot data is located in Appendix B.  All plants found within the characteristic plots were identified to species level where possible.  In some cases, identification was only possible to the genus level (i.e., non-reproductive Muhlenbergia and Carex species).  Visual estimates of percent cover were made for all species, including live material and the current year's standing dead.  To maintain consistency with local vegetation surveys and other work of KBS, a continuous range of possible cover estimates was used, rather than cover classes.  Plants that covered less than one half of one percent of the plot were classified as a "trace" (T).  Also to maintain consistency with published accounts and similar projects in the region, species were assigned names following the Flora of the Great Plains (McGregor and Barkley 1986).  An updated synonymy was completed when data were entered into the PLOTS database.  Noteworthy surrounding vegetation, slopes, unusual soil features, and noticeable use by animals were also noted at each plot.  Most of HOME had been previously plowed for agriculture, but has recently been restored to prairie, and many of the plots were on a gentle slope with an A horizon of silt or silty clay loam soils.

Additional plot data were obtained from the Heartland Inventory and Monitoring Network, which had sampling data from 2005 and 2006 on ten permanent plots.  Each plot is comprised of two transects 50 m in length, with ten sets of nested subplots systematically arranged.  Working from the smallest to the largest plot, all herbaceous, woody shrub and tree seedling and sapling species were identified.  Foliar cover was estimated in the 100 m2 subplot using a modified Daubenmire (1959) scale.  Trees less than 5.0 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were tallied by species in each 100 m2 subplot.  In woodland communities, stem density was used to estimate abundance of tree species.  Seedlings and saplings were counted and assigned to one of three size classes (&lt;0.5 m dbh, 0.5-2.5 m dbh, or 2.5-5.0 m dbh).  The 0.1 ha area between the two transects was used to collect data on the woody species greater than 5.0 cm dbh in the understory and overstory canopy layers.  Diameter at breast height was measured for each individual tree greater than or equal to 5.0 cm.

For additional attribute information, see the homedata.mdb file assiciated with this project.

The 2009 accuracy assessment effort yielded 12 points that were distributed throughout HOME; none were sampled in the environs due to access constraints.

During analysis of the AA points, a GIS point file was created from the AA point coordinates recorded in the field.  These were then overlaid on the vegetation map and a comparison of the final AA field call versus the vegetation polygon label was conducted.

Examination of the final error matrix shows that there was no confusion between map units, as the accuracy assessment resulted in 100% accuracy.  This high level of accuracy is likely due to the small size of HOME which allowed thorough sampling during the vegetation mapping stage.</abstract>
      <purpose>To show the location of sample points and accuracy assessement points visited at Homestead National Monument. The intended use of all data in the park's GIS library is to support diverse park activities including planning, management, maintenance, research, and interpretation.</purpose>
