      <abstract>This polygon feature class represents vegetation communities mapped at Dinosaur National Monument. The polygons were delineated following guidelines set by the National Vegetation Classification System (October 1995). Original lines were drawn on a mylar overlay on top of printed 1:12,000 digital scale orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ), collected in the summer of 2002. Hard copy 9X9 stereo aerial photography was used for photo interpretation. Intuitive ecological modeling and visual interpretation cues, such as shape, size, pattern, tone, texture, color, and shadow, were used to develop the polygons. Additional data layers used to aid the interpretation include slope, hydrology, geography, and ground-collected vegetation information. The lines developed in the image interpretation step were scanned using a large format scanner. The resultant scanned raster image was converted into a vector coverage to facilitate editing the linework within ArcGIS. The line work was cleaned, polygons created and attributed. The attributed vegetation classes were subjected to an accuracy assessment, following which final adjustments were made to the vegetation classes. As with any digital layer, this layer is a representation of what is actually occurring on the ground. Errors are inherent in any interpretation of ground qualities. Due to the "snapshot" nature of the DOQs, this vegetation layer reflects conditions that existed when the imagery was collected.</abstract>
      <purpose>This polygon layer represents vegetation communities found at the Dinosaur National Monument. The intended use of all data in the park's GIS library is to support diverse park activities including planning, management, maintenance, research, and interpretation.</purpose>

    <overview>
      <eaover>The National Vegetation Classification Standard is organized hierarchically to support conservation and resource stewardship applications across multiple scales. The upper levels of the hierarchy are based on the physical form or structure of the vegetation (physiognomy) and have been refined from the international standards developed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The two most detailed levels of the hierarchy are based on the species composition of existing vegetation (floristics) and reflect the phyto-sociological standards that were originally developed by European ecologists. The vegetation classification is continually advanced through the collection and analysis of new field data and will be greatly strengthened during the course of the USGS/NPS mapping efforts. Data file attributes include vegetation height, density, species, alliance, community element, and land cover.
OBJECTID - ObjectID - Sequential unique whole numbers automatically generated.
SHAPE - Geometry - Feature geometry, ESRI autogenerated.
Polygon_ID- Text - Unique polygon identifier created for relationship purposes.
Map_Unit_ID - Text - Code delineating the Map Unit for DINO.
Map_Unit_Common_Name - Text - The common name of the map unit for DINO. Edit_Date - Date - The date the polygon was last edited.
Edit_Notes - Text - Notes detailing any edits made to a polygon.
SHAPE_Length - Double - Length of feature in internal units.
SHAPE_Area - Double - Area of feature in internal units squared.
Acres - Double - Acres calculated using ArcMap geometry function.
Hectares - Double - Hectares created using ArcMap geometry function</eaover>
