      <abstract>Accuracy Assessment, Observation and Plot Points</abstract>
      <purpose>To assist with the development of vegetation maps for the National Park Service. Plots were collected to characterize actual vegetation, while accuracy assessment plots were visited to verify the mapper's interpretation of the vegetation communities.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Data were reformatted to match Plots V3.0 by the Colorado Natural Heritage Program/Colorado State University. Four types of points were collected:

AA observations - Accuracy Assessment plots to capture data used to check the accuracy of vegetation maps delivered by contracted photo-interpreters. Dominant species were recorded by stratum. A handful of Accuracy Assessment observations were given to the photo-interpreters as training points for recognition of vegetation types in Sequoia and Kings Canyon. Plot size = 0.5 ha (5000 m2).

Plots - Exhaustive plot observations, including identification of all species within the plot area, for vegetation classification. These plots aided in the development of the floristics classification for Sequoia and Kings Canyon. All Plots were given to the photo-interpreters as training points for recognition of vegetation types in Sequoia and Kings Canyon. Plot size varies according to type.

RA observations - Rapid Assessment plots to capture rapid vegetation observations. Dominant species were recorded by stratum. This type of plot was established to answer photo-interpreter questions about the vegetation in specific areas. All Rapid Assessment observations were given to the photo-interpreters as training points for recognition of vegetation types in Sequoia and Kings Canyon. Plot size varies according to type.

WP observations - Waypoint plots to capture rapid vegetation observations. These plots were extreme rapid observations and were usually performed to answer a photo-interpreter question about the vegetation, or to capture a snapshot of a site while traveling between sample points. Dominant species were recorded. All 2003 Waypoint observations and a handful of 2004 observations were given to the photo-interpreters as training points for recognition of vegetation types in Sequoia and Kings Canyon. Plot size variable: corresponded to immediate area sampled.</supplinf>

        <procdesc>Field observations began in 2000 and continued through 2004. In 2000 a database system to record SEKI plot data, Plots Database System.mdb, was developed for the NPS vegetation mapping program by Jim Drake of the Nature Conservancy. Plot data was stored in this database through the course of the project.   Over time this software became incompatible with current operating systems, and we elected to discontinue its use. In fall of 2004, the data tables from the plots database system were exported and transformed into the current Access database, SEKI_VM_Plotdata.mdb. During this process fields were re-named and formatted to create a database better suited to the needs of the SEKI vegetation mapping program.

In 2003, PDA technology was used to record a subset of the field data. Digital data entry forms were created for Handspring VisorPro PDAs using Pendragon Forms software version 3.2, and these were electronically linked to the access tables used to store the field data. Note that due to the restructuring of the database, these digital forms no longer map to the plot data tables and cannot be used.</procdesc>
