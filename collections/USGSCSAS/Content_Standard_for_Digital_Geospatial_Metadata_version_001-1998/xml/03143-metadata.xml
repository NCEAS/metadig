      <abstract>The plot point contains 255 point locations of field plot and observation data used by, and collected for, the vegetation mapping project for Fossil Butte National Monument. Plots and observation points were located subjectively in representative vegetation throughout the park. Field crews decided where and when to use observation points or vegetation plots to sample the vegetation. Vegetation plots (158) were placed in stands judged by field crews to represent legitimate vegetation types that could be classified to the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) system using standard multivariate analysis techniques. Observation points (97) were placed in stands (1) if the vegetation was highly altered and therefore not classifiable, (2) to provide information about the distribution of common vegetation types adequately sampled in vegetation plots, or (3) if the stand represented a unique vegetation type that was too small to hold a 400m2 sample plot. Plot and observation locations were collected in the summer of 2005 and were GPSed (primarily using recreational GPS units), coordinates noted on the field sheets and then transcribed into the MS Access Plots database. For 22 plot locations, fuels data was also collected. Field photos are associated with each plot.

The AA point displays the 661 accuracy assessment (AA) points visited in the late summer of 2006 as part of the vegetation mapping project. The points were randomly selected, stratified by the map units used for vegetation mapping and further screened so as not to fall on inaccessible areas. The coordinates were uploaded to Garmin hand-held GPS receivers so that ecologists could navigate to them in the field and the locations where data were collected. Some AA points fell on ecotones and two sets of data were recorded on the evenly-split sites. AA points that fell along polygon edges sometimes did not represent the entire polygon well and some AA points fell on small patches of vegetation that were different than the community in the larger polygon. Due to a prescribed burn, 39 AA points were collected during plot work (2005) and used as AA points. Field photos are associated with each plot. Only points within the NPS boundary were visited; the accuracy of the vegetation map outside the park boundary is untested.</abstract>
      <purpose>Data were collected in plots and at observation points to characterize the vegetation at Fossil Butte National Monument, while accuracy assessment plots were visited to verify the mapper's interpretation of the vegetation communities. These points show the location of plot, observation points and accuracy assessment points visited. The intended use of all data in the park's GIS library is to support diverse park activities including planning, management, maintenance, research, and interpretation.</purpose>
