      <abstract>High resolution vegetation polygons mapped by the National Park Service. This is the vegetation of Yosemite National Park and beyond the boundary. The data were produced from 1997 color infrared analog photographs flown by Photo Science through a nationwide contract. ESRI (Environmental Systems Research Institute) was the contrator that coordinated the work. Hundreds of vegetation plots were surveyed within the park and outside the park boundaries by the National Park Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, and The Nature Conservancy. The photointerpretation of the 1997 photos was performed by Aerial Information Systems (Redlands, CA). Photointerpretation was conducted manually using analog photos in stereo pairs and then the polygon boundaries were georeferenced to DOQQS to georectify the map. A plant community classification was developed by NatureServe (in cooperation with the California Department of Fish and Game and California Native Plant Society) by running cluster analysis on the plot data from 604 sites surveyed in 1998 and 1999, 362 sites surveyed in 1989 to 1993, and 774 sites surveyed in 1935 to 1937. A list of mappable types was developed and crosswalked to the floristic classification based on the cluster analysis. Photointerpretation and georectification were completed in 2003; accuracy assessment was completed in 2006.</abstract>
      <purpose>Vegetation maps of National Parks and National Monuments were developed to support natural resources management, planning, research and interpretation.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Data were imported to a file geodatabase by the Colorado Natural Heritage Program/Colorado State University. Parks had the flexibility to map vegetation down to the map class or to the association.</supplinf>

      <attraccr>The data have a high accuracy (in terms of correct vegetation assignments) with the majority meeting the minimum standard of 80 percent correct by type for those types assessed for accuracy. Fewer than 10 assessed types fell between 75 and 80 percent accurate.</attraccr>

    <complete>As of July 2007 the vegetation map was finalized following a process of quality assessment by a subcontractor who checked the accuracy of the mapping classification (vegetation type) assignments. Accuracy was increased to greater than 80% through a process of lumping classes together.</complete>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Using 1997 analog color infrared photographs (1;15,840), distinct vegetation units were manually drawn onto mylar overlays. These overlays were then digitized and georeferenced to digital ortho photoquads. On the ground, a total of approximately 1900 vegetation plots were surveyed to classify the vegetation. These plots consisted of historical Weislander plot data (1935-1937), plots surveyed between 1989 and 1993 (NRI) and plots surveyed in 1998 and 1999 (Nature Conservancy). The plot data were used to create a new floristic vegetation classification for the Yosemite region down to the association level. The data were then run through an accuracy assessment analysis based on 2200 sites visited and assigned a floristic class. These assignments were compared with the mapping classification assignment for each polygon visited and scored according to accuracy at the association or alliance level.</procdesc>
