      <abstract>This point class contains 649 point locations of field plot and observation data used by, and collected for, the vegetation mapping project for Bryce Canyon National Park. Plots and observation points were located subjectively in representative vegetation throughout the park. Field crews decided where and when to use observation points or vegetation plots to sample the vegetation. Vegetation plots (408) were placed in stands judged by field crews to represent legitimate vegetation types that could be classified to the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) system using standard multivariate analysis techniques. Observation points (141) were placed in stands (1) if the vegetation was highly altered and therefore not classifiable, (2) to provide information about the distribution of common vegetation types adequately sampled in vegetation plots, or (3) if the stand represented a unique vegetation type that was too small to hold a 400m2 sample plot (e.g., seeps, hanging gardens). Plot and observation locations were collected in the summers of 2005 and 2006 and were GPSed (primarily using mapping grade GPS units), coordinates were downloaded from GPS units, corrected then uploaded into the BRCA Plots Microsoft Access database. Field photos are associated with each plot.

This point class contains the 902 accuracy assessment (AA) points visited in the summer of 2007 as part of the vegetation mapping project. The points were randomly selected, stratified by the map units used for vegetation mapping and further screened so as not to fall in inaccessible areas or vertical canyon walls. The coordinates were uploaded to Trimble hand-held GPS receivers so that ecologists could navigate to them in the field and the locations where data were collected were updated. Some AA points fell on ecotones and two sets of data were recorded on the evenly-split sites. AA points that fell along polygon edges sometimes did not represent the entire polygon well and some AA points fell on small patches of vegetation that were different than the community in the larger polygon. Field photos are associated with each plot. Only points within the NPS boundary were visited; the accuracy of the vegetation map outside the park boundary is untested. This point class also contains the 328 fuel points.</abstract>
      <purpose>Data were collected in plots and at observation points to characterize the vegetation at Bryce Canyon National Park. These points show the location of plot, observation points, accuracy assessment points and fuels points visited. The accuracy assessment plots were visited to verify the mappers interpretation of the vegetation communities. The intended use of all data in the park's GIS library is to support diverse park activities including planning, management, maintenance, research, and interpretation.</purpose>
