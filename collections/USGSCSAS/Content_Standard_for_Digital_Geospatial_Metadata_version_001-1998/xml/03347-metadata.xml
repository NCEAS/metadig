      <abstract>The National Park Service (NPS), in conjunction with the Biological Resources Division (BRD) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has implemented a program to "develop a uniform hierarchical vegetation methodology" at a national level. The program will also create a geographic information system (GIS) database for the parks under its management. The purpose of the data is to document the state of vegetation within the NPS service area during the 1990's, thereby providing a baseline study for further analysis at the Regional or Service-wide level. The vegetation at Devils Tower National Monument was mapped using 1:16,000 scale U.S. Forest Service Color Aerial Photography acquired July 29, 1993. The mapping classification used two separate classification systems. All natural vegetation used the National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) as a base. The vegetation classifcation was created after extensive on site sampling and numerical analysis. The vegetation map units were derived from the vegatation classification. Other non-natural or cultural mapping units used the Anderson Level II classification system. The mapped area includes a buffer around the Monument boundary.</abstract>
      <purpose>This mapping effort originates from a long-term vegetation monitoring program that is part of a larger Inventory and Monitoring (I&amp;M) program started by the National Park Service (NPS). I&amp;M goals are, among others, to map the vegetation of all national parks and monuments and provide a baseline inventory of vegetation. The I&amp;M program currently works in close cooperation with the Biological Resources Division (BRD) of the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS/BRD continues overall management and oversight of all ongoing mapping efforts in close cooperation with the NPS.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The purposes of the mapping effort are varied and include the following: Provides support for NPS Resources Management. Promotes vegetation-related research for both NPS and USGS/BRD. Provides support for NPS Planning and Compliance. Adds to the information base for NPS Interpretation. Assists in NPS Operations. The Shapefile was imported into a geodatabase by the National Park Service.</supplinf>

    <logic>All polygon features are checked for topology using the ARC/INFO software. Each polygon begins and ends at the same point with the node feature. All nodes are checked for error so that there are no dangling features. There are no duplicate lines or polygons. All nodes will snap together and close polygons based on a specified tolerance. If the node is not with the tolerance it is adjusted manually. The tests for logical consistency are performed in ARC/INFO using certain commands.</logic>
    <complete>All data that can be photo-interpreted is also digitized. This includes features that fall into the NVCS vegetation classification and the Anderson Level II classification. Minimum mapping unit is ostensibly .5 hectares but some low frequency classes below the MMU are included.</complete>

        <methdesc>Developmental of Programmatic and Technical Team:
This project required the combined expertise and oversight of several organizations. Oversight and programmatic considerations are managed by the Center for Biological Informatics of the Biological Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey. The National Park Service provided additional guidance. The technical responsibilities for the mapping effort were divided between TNC and BOR. TNC responsibilities and deliverables included the following: Create a vegetation classification system based upon field species level data and consistent with the Standard National Classification System at the Alliance or Community Element level Provide documentation that describes the national classes at the local and global levels, with field keys, and field data in a *.dbf format. Provide technical opinion to BOR as the mapping portion of the project proceeds. Provide field notes and site descriptions BOR responsibilities and deliverables included the following: Digital files of vegetation on Compact (CD); including topology and labeling for height, density, and pattern subclasses; location of field sample sites; and locations of sites used for accuracy assessment in Arc/Info format Any ancillary digital files developed during the mapping process Digital FGDC compliant metadata file for each digital file delivered Annotated field site photographs Original mylar overlays of interpreted photographs Hard copy vegetation map Accuracy assessment Final report describing all procedures used in developing the final map and accuracy assessment Planning and Review Meeting An initial meeting was held with all interested parties to discuss several aspects of the mapping effort. Foremost among these was the mapping extent. Vegetation issues particular to the park were addressed. Devils Tower National Monument was responsible for obtaining permission from adjacent land owners for property access for sampling purposes. Most of the private lands were under some form of grazing or farming. Consequently, sampling on these lands was not necessary. The remainder of the lands within the mapping area are U.S. Forest Service Lands so permission was not necessary. Preliminary Data Collection and Review of Existing Information To reduce duplicating previous work and to help in our effort we collected existing vegetation reports and maps from the staff at Devils Tower National Monument. These materials were referenced during the mapping process and the information contained in them was incorporated where it was deemed useful. Because soils also affect the distribution of vegetation, soil maps and soil descriptions were also obtained as reference. These were not converted to a digital file. Digital elevation models (DEM) were obtained to create slope and aspect maps that helped in determining vegetation community distribution. Vegetation Sampling The sampling approach used in this mapping effort was typical of small park sampling, where all polygons within the park boundary are sampled. Two levels of field data gathering were conducted in this park; plots and observations. Plots represented the most intensive sampling of the landscape and used TNC's 'Plot Form'. Observations consisted of brief descriptions and were designed to obtain a quick overview of the landscape without spending a large amount of time at each sample site. Observation points used the 'Observation Form' data sheet. Examples of both 'Plot' and 'Observation' forms are included in the companion report by TNC. Initially, plots were used to describe the vegetation of the park. A total of 28 plots were obtained from August 20 through August 24, 1996. These plots were used by TNC to describe the vegetation associations found within the park. These descriptions are in the companion report by TNC. Map Validation A field trip was conducted in June of 1997 to assess the initial mapping effort and to refine map class.</methdesc>

        <srccontr>Photo interpretation was done by trained interpreters familiar with the vegetation communities of the Monument on overlays registered to the aerial photographs under a stereoscope.  Vegetation communities were idendified on the basis of their color, pattern, texture, and location on the landscape and lines were drawn around the communities. The photo interpreters had visited the monument and conferred with the ecologists who performed the vegetation classification and were familiar with the vegetation communities. Not all vegetation associations could be identified on the photography due to size constraints and complexity of the vegetation.  Map classes were assigned in these cases and a cross-walk was made to the vegetation classification.</srccontr>
      </srcinfo>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Air Photo Interpretation All map classes were interpreted from existing 1:16,000 scale, color photography taken on July 29, 1993. The photographs were acquired from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). Photointerpretation used the standard identification features such as tone, texture, color, pattern, topographic position, and shadow. In addition, field sample locations and their vegetation descriptions aided in assigning map class to each polygon. All photographs were examined using a stereoscope. Digital elevation models (DEM's) were processed and converted to slope and aspect coverages. These helped to provide additional perspectives of the landscape. Seven photographs were interpreted for the entire mapping area. Digital scans of these photographs are included as .tif files on the CD included with this report.</procdesc>

The TNC biologist "pin-pricked" all of the sample site locations onto the aerial photos while the NBS staff captured the location using GPS. The "pin-pricked" locations were subsequently input into the GIS database for comparison against the GPS locations for the same site.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>The database contains two separate classification systems. The two systems represent vegetation map units and land cover map units. The vegetation map units are usually combinations of vegetation associations described in the TNC companion report. The vegetation map units have also been categorized into 5 general vegetation classes. The land use map units use the Anderson Level II classification system. The vegetation attributes contain character codes and descriptors. The land use contain numeric codes. The descriptors are available in two look-up tables provided with this data set. These are map.lut and anderson.lut. Modifiers also exist representing percent of vegetation cover and tree height. These modifiers are available in the look-up table structure.lut. Contact David Salas at the Bureau of Reclamation Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Group D-8260 for more information about the classification system.
