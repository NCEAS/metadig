      <abstract>The plot point displays the 525 field plot and observation locations visited in 2003 and 2004 as part of the vegetation mapping project for Colorado National Monument. The data collected were used for the vegetation classification and mapping of the park. Sample plots were located subjectively in representative vegetation throughout the Monument. A map of soils and geology overlain on topography helped field crews maximize the diversity of sites sampled. Field crews decided where and when to use observation points or vegetation plots to sample the vegetation. Vegetation plots were placed in stands judged by field crews to represent legitimate vegetation types that could be classified to the NVC using standard multivariate analysis techniques. Observation points were placed in stands (1) if the vegetation was highly altered and therefore not classifiable, (2) to provide information about the distribution of common vegetation types adequately sampled in vegetation plots, or (3) if the stand represented a unique vegetation type that was too small to hold a 400m2 sample plot (e.g., seeps, Oregon grape shrubland). Fuels data was collected at a subset of the plots visited, and 360 degree movie files were taken of the vegetation. Nine hundred and twenty photographs were also taken of plot and observation locations.

The AA point displays the 500 accuracy assessment (AA) points visited in July and August of 2004 as part of the vegetation mapping project. Five hundred and one accuracy assessment points were created for COLM (2 were inaccessible) by Keith Landgraf and Steve Blauer of the USGS-RMMC. The points were randomly selected, stratified by the map units used for vegetation mapping and further screened so as not to fall on inaccessible isolated mesa tops and vertical canyon walls. The coordinates were uploaded to Garmin hand-held GPS receivers so that ecologists could navigate to them in the field. Some AA points fell on ecotones and two sets of data were recorded on the evenly-split site. AA points that fell along polygon edges sometimes did not represent the entire polygon well and some AA points fell on small patches of vegetation that were different than the community in the larger area. Many recently dead Pinus edulis trees were present on the landscape and would appear on the 2002 aerial photos as living. Notes were taken to support these observations during the AA point evaluation phase of the project. For all AA data collection, whenever an unknown species was encountered, a sample was collected and keyed to accurately establish its identity. In addition to collecting vegetation data, photographs were taken at each location visited -- approximately 1,000 images were acquired to illustrate the AA sites visited.</abstract>
      <purpose>Plots were collected to characterize the vegetation and accuracy assessment points visited at Colorado National Monument. These points show the location of plot, observation points and accuracy assessment points visited. The intended use of all data in the park's GIS library is to support diverse park activities including planning, management, maintenance, research, and interpretation.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Established May 24, 1911, and on 20,453.932 acres, Colorado National Monument consists of geologic features including: towering red sandstone monoliths, deep sheer-walled canyons, and a variety of wildlife (bighorn sheep, golden eagles, mule deer, and mountain lions).</supplinf>
