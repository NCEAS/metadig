<abstract>The geographic information system (GIS) format spatial data set of vegetation for Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (SLBE) was created for the National Park Service (NPS) Vegetation Inventory Program (VIP). The SLBE covers an area of over 24,000 ha (59,305 acres) and over 28,000 ha (69,190 acres) with the ~400 m surface water jurisdiction into Lake Michigan included. The map classification scheme used to create the vegetation data set is designed to represent local vegetation types at the finest level possible using the National Vegetation Classification Standard (NVCS) Version 2. Physiognomic information was also recorded, including height (woody vegetation), canopy density, and coverage patterns. The vegetation data set was developed by interpreting aerial photographs collected in 2007 and extensive field surveys. Individuals who cooperated in this project include; USGS Center for Biological Informatics, NPS Biological Resources Management Division, USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, NPS Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, and NatureServe. The vegetation data are distributed as an ESRI format file geodatabase, stored in Universal Transverse Mercator zone 16 mapping coordinates, North American Datum 1983.</abstract>
<purpose>The NPS VIP is an effort to classify, describe, and map existing vegetation of national park units. Managed by the NPS Biological Resources Management Division, the NPS VIP provides baseline vegetation information for the NPS Natural Resource I&amp;M Program. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Vegetation Characterization Program lends a cooperative role in the NPS VIP and serves the data sets on the Internet. Vegetation layers and associated information support a wide variety of resource assessment, park management, and planning needs. They also provide structure for framing and answering critical scientific questions about vegetation communities and their relation to environmental processes across the landscape.</purpose>

<attraccr>Based on a thematic AA study that was conducted of map classes representing floristic types in the NVCS, the vegetation map of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore has an overall attribute accuracy of 77.8% (Kappa index of 76.7%); calculated using field data collected at 1,016 accuracy assessment observation sites. Most individual map-class themes exceed the NPS VIP standard of 80% with a 90% confidence interval. The project report provides details pertaining to the methods of the accuracy assessment study and the results from the analysis.</attraccr>
</attracc>
<logic>All polygon features were checked for potential topology and attribute errors using the software program ArcGIS (version 9.3). Topology checks were performed to make sure each polygon was closed, no dangling features were present, each polygon contained a labeling point, and to make sure that no duplicate lines, polygons, or labels were present.</logic>
<complete>All features identified by the photointerpreters were automated. Map-code information produced by the photointerpreters (e.g., vegetation type, height, vegetation cover) is stored in the attribute table of the data set and in a series of lookup tables. The map codes are cross-referenced to the NVCS (Vr2) at all physiognomic and floristic levels. The NPS VIP standard minimum mapping unit (MMU) of 0.5 ha (1.24 acres) was applied for mapping. For vegetation types unique to their immediate surroundings (e.g., emergent wetland within an upland forest setting), a MMU down to 0.25 ha was applied. In addition, a secondary MMU of 2.0 ha was applied for physiognomic feature changes within a particular map class (e.g., open versus closed forest). A set of MMU templates were used to help photointerpreters determine minimum polygon size during the interpretive process. Because of angle distortions inherent to nonrectified aerial photos, and slight scale changes from high ridges to valley bottoms, the MMU was applied liberally.</complete>
<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>The photointerpreted data were georeferenced and orthorectified using the software program Orthomapper, 3.75-minute USGS digital orthophoto quadrangles, and 1/3-degree national elevation data sets. The reference orthophotos have a horizontal root mean square error (RMSE) of no greater than 7.0 meters.  Field control for the orthophoto's reference images were acquired by third order class 1 or better survey methods, sufficiently spaced to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) for 1:12,000-scale products.</horizpar>
</horizpa>
<vertacc>
<vertaccr>No elevation information is stored in this data set.  Instead, elevation data was used during the orthorectification process minimize or eliminate distortions caused by changes in elevation.</vertaccr>

<othercit>A digital orthophoto is a digital image of an aerial photograph in which displacements caused by the camera and the terrain have been removed. It combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The UMESC was supplied with orthorectified 2007 CIR images of SLBE.  These images were used to orthorectify interpreted overlays of the same vintage photography.  Standard operating procedures were modified to accommodate the base imagery delivered by the vendor. The contractor used to collect and produce the orthophotos was AlliedGIS (Pinnacle Mapping, subcontractor).</othercit>

The digital orthophotos were used by the software program Orthomapper as an existing data set that has already been orthophotos (i.e., georeferenced, and elevation distortions have been removed). The photo overlays are aligned with the orthophotos, then the software program uses data stored in the orthophoto images along with available elevation data to georeference and remove elevation distortions from the photo overlays (i.e., orthorectify).</srccontr>

<srccitea>24K True Color Photos</srccitea>
<srccontr>In April 2007, SLBE was photographed using true color film at a scale of 1:12,000. The timing of these photographs was intended to capture deciduous forest leaf-off conditions so that understory conditions could be viewed. These photographs were used as an ancillary photo set to determine understory characteristics during the photointerpretation process. They were used in support of photointerpreting the 12K Color IR Photos, which was the primary source of imagery for mapping.</srccontr>
</srcinfo>
<procstep>
<procdesc>Mapping vegetation of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (SLBE) and environs involved five primary steps: (1) preliminary map classification (2) field reconnaissance, (3) map classification, (4) photointerpretation, and (5) digital map automation and database development. Although these steps occurred sequentially, they overlap to some degree.</procdesc>
<procdate>2010</procdate>
</procstep>
<procstep>
<procdesc>Preliminary Map Classification and Field Reconnaissance: Prior to field reconnaissance, mappers (UMESC) met with vegetation classifiers (NatureServe) to discuss the vegetation classification and how vegetation types might best be represented in a workable map classification. This built a working draft of the map classification to be used during field visits by the mappers. Before photointerpretation was initiated, photointerpreters made several visits to SLBE to perform field reconnaissance.  Field visits were performed to a variety of locations within the SLBE. Printed copies of the aerial photos that would be used during the photointerpretation process were brought along so conditions on the ground could be compared to images contained in the photos. These trips helped the photointerpreters further establish the map classification, determine what vegetation types could be identified within the aerial photos, and establish mapping convention on how best to apply the mapping of the vegetation types.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Map Classification: The ultimate goal of the map classification was to represent the vegetation types of SLBE as determined by the vegetation classifiers (NatureServe). The photointerpreters cooperated with the vegetation specialists to determine which vegetation types and communities could be accurately identified using the aerial photography. Some of the classes appearing in the final vegetation map might be comprised of a single vegetation type as identified by the vegetation classifiers, and others may contain one of several different types. Not all vegetation types visible on the ground are identifiable in an aerial photograph.</procdesc>

Photointerpretation was performed on the October 2007 1:12,000-scale color infrared diapositives, using acetate overlays, Rapidograph ink pens (4x0-size, 0.18 mm) and Rapidraw black India ink (3084; waterproof, fast drying for film). Features within the entire project extent were mapped. Detailed information on how the photointerpretation processes were performed is available in the project report.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Orthorectification: Each aerial photograph was scanned, producing a series of Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) images. The software program OrthoMapper was then used to register each image, establishing both horizontal and vertical coordinates. Existing orthophoto quadrangles (3.75-minute digital products) produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) were used to derive horizontal coordinates, and 1/3 arc second digital elevation models (DEMs) were used to derive vertical measurements. Once orthophotos were created from the scanned photographs, each photointerpreted overlay was scanned to create a 2-bit (black-and-white) TIFF image. The software OrthoMapper was then used to process each overlay, using the orthophoto created from overlay's corresponding aerial photograph to orthorectify the interpreted overlay. The individual orthorectified photos and overlays were then merged into workable groups for subsequent digitizing.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Conversion to GIS format files: The software program ArcGIS Desktop was then used to convert the orthorectified overlays into a GIS format data. The software program's ArcScan processing module was used to convert the raster images into vector data. A series of checks were performed to search for potential errors, then the photointerpreter's map attribute codes were added to the vector data.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Creation of the Geodatabase: The attribute table of the initial GIS format vegetation map contained only the map attribute codes that were assigned by the photointerpreters. To make these data more meaningful, a series of lookup tables were created, which contained items such as the map class names, physiognomic information (woody plant heights, area of coverage, distribution patterns), and all NVCS Vr2 hierarchy codes and nomenclature (when known and applicable), including the finest floristic level of the hierarchy, association. An ESRI format File Geodatabase was created to hold these data, as well as the vegetation point data that were collected for developing the vegetation classification and for the AA of the vegetation map, the project boundary extent, and aerial photograph information. A series of relationship class files were added to the file geodatabase, to make it easier for users to associate the lookup tables with the GIS datasets.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Accuracy Assessment: An in-depth accuracy project was performed on the geographic information system (GIS) format vegetation polygon data set (vegetation map). This was done to measure the probability of map accuracy (or, the absence of error). A series of computer selected random sampling sites were chosen for each map class in the data set. The mapping coordinates of these sites were then provided to field crews, who used global positioning system (GPS) receivers to locate each site. The field data and calls at each of these sites were compared to polygon data and calls made by the photointerpreters to determine the thematic accuracy of the vegetation map. Detailed information on how this assessment was performed and its results are available in the project report.</procdesc>
