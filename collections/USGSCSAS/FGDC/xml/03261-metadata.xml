      <abstract>The plot point contains 1,287 point locations of field plot and observation data used by, and collected for, the vegetation mapping project for Canyonlands National Park. Plots and observation points were located subjectively in representative vegetation throughout the park. Field crews decided where and when to use observation points or vegetation plots to sample the vegetation. Vegetation plots (914) were placed in stands judged by field crews to represent legitimate vegetation types that could be classified to the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) system using standard multivariate analysis techniques. Observation points were placed in stands (1) if the vegetation was highly altered and therefore not classifiable, (2) to provide information about the distribution of common vegetation types adequately sampled in vegetation plots, or (3) if the stand represented a unique vegetation type that was too small to hold a 400m2 sample plot (e.g., seeps, hanging gardens). Plot and observation locations were collected in 2003-2004 and were GPSed, coordinates noted on the field sheets and then transcribed into the MS Access Plots database. Field photos are associated with each location.

The AA point file displays the 2,043 accuracy assessment (AA) points visited in 2007-2009 as part of the vegetation mapping project. The points were randomly selected, stratified by the map units used for vegetation mapping and further screened so as not to fall on inaccessible isolated mesa tops or vertical canyon walls. The coordinates were uploaded to Trimble and Garmin hand-held GPS receivers so that ecologists could navigate to them in the field and the locations where data were collected were updated. Some AA points fell on ecotones and two sets of data were recorded on the evenly-split sites. AA points that fell along polygon edges sometimes did not represent the entire polygon well and some AA points fell on small patches of vegetation that were different than the community in the larger polygon. Eight points were thrown out after analysis because they represented non-vegetated areas not intended for AA sampling. Field photos are associated with each plot. Only points within the NPS boundary were visited; the accuracy of the vegetation map outside the park boundary is untested.</abstract>
      <purpose>Data were collected in plots and at observation points to characterize the vegetation at Canyonlands National Park, while accuracy assessment plots were visited to verify the mappers interpretation of the vegetation communities. These points show the location of plot, observation points and accuracy assessment points visited. The intended use of all data in the park's GIS library is to support diverse park activities including planning, management, maintenance, research, and interpretation.</purpose>

Recreational GPS receivers generally have horizontal errors of 2-15 meters (less than 40 meters). GPS accuracy varies for each plot. Error values were recorded on the plot form. The AA data was collected using primarily mapping grade GPS receivers (generally Trimbles, Garmins as backups). A meters error reading was recorded when applicable. GPS accuracy varies for each plot.
