<abstract>The vegetation point data layer for the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (SLBE) vegetation mapping project was developed to show locations and to provide field data from two efforts associated with the vegetation mapping project, of which both support the vegetation polygon data layer (vegetation map) produced of SLBE (based from interpreting aerial imagery that was collected in October 2007). These two efforts include 1) vegetation plot sampling data and 2) AA site data. Vegetation plot sampling was conducted to describe vegetation types and to develop the map classification scheme. A total of 120 vegetation plots were sampled at SLBE. A detailed vegetation analysis of these data along with information collected from previous classification projects were used to develop the map classification scheme, in accordance with the National Vegetation Classification Standard (NVCS) Version 2. The AA site sampling was conducted measure the probability that a particular location has been assigned its correct vegetation class in the vegetation map layer. An AA estimates thematic errors in the data, giving users information needed to determine data suitability for a particular application. Two views of an AA are provided: 1) &amp;#147;producers&amp;#146; accuracy,&amp;#148; which is the probability that an AA point has been mapped correctly (also referred to as an error of omission), and 2) &amp;#147;users&amp;#146; accuracy,&amp;#148; which is the probability that the map actually represents what was found on the ground (also referred to as error of commission). The AA was performed on map classes representing floristic level vegetation types in the NVCS (and one map class representing a group level type). A total of 1,024 AA observation sites were collected, and 1,016 were used in the analysis. From the thematic AA study, results present an overall accuracy of 77.8% (kappa index of 76.7%) based on data from 1,016 of the 1,024 AA sites. Most individual map-class themes exceed the NPS VIP standard of 80% with a 90% confidence interval. Results are shown via a contingency table. The project report for the SLBE vegetation mapping project provides details pertaining to the methods of the vegetation plot sampling and accuracy assessment studies, as well as results from the analyses of each study. The vegetation database used to populate the feature classes and relationship classes of the vegetation point data locations is available on the program&amp;#146;s websites. The GIS data set contains point data features, projected to Universal Transverse Mercator zone 16 mapping coordinates, North American Datum 1983.</abstract>
<purpose>The NPS VIP is an effort to classify, describe, and map existing vegetation of national park units. Managed by the NPS Biological Resources Management Division, the NPS VIP provides baseline vegetation information for the NPS Natural Resource I&amp;M Program. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Vegetation Characterization Program lends a cooperative role in the NPS VIP and serves the data sets on the Internet. Vegetation layers and associated information support a wide variety of resource assessment, park management, and planning needs. They also provide structure for framing and answering critical scientific questions about vegetation communities and their relation to environmental processes across the landscape.</purpose>

<procdesc>Vegetation Plots: All field data were entered into PLOTS2, an MS Access database designed for this vegetation mapping program (NatureServe 2005b). These plots were analyzed using ordination (non-metric multidimensional scaling or NMS) and clustering techniques (Flexible Beta) with PC-Ord 5.0 (McCune and Mefford 1999). Data were then converted to a point shapefile in ArcGIS 9.3. Results of this analysis are available in the project report for SLBE, available on the program's websites.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Accuracy Assessment: Field crews were provided with listings of GPS coordinates of their (AA sites along with field maps. During the summer of 2009, field crews navigated to their sampling sites, then established AA observation plots within the minimum mapping unit (MMU) area. A number of physical characteristics were recorded for each site (e.g., location, slope, aspect, elevation) along with land cover information (e.g., dominant and subdominant vegetation, percent cover). Detailed descriptions on how these plots were established and sampled are available in the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore vegetation mapping project report, available online. A total of 1,024 AA sites were collected.</procdesc>

<enttypl>slbe_vegpt</enttypl>
<enttypd>The slbe_vegpt attribute table contains the attribute information directly associated with the vegetation point data set. If this data set were to be exported out of the file geodatabase and saved as a shapefile, the information contained within fcl_slbe_vegpt are the attributes which would carry through to the new shapefile. The other attribute/lookup tables (e.g., tbl_vegpt_vp_clsf, tbl_vegpt_vp_location, etc.) contain additional information and are associated to the feature class data set within the geodatabase, through a series of geodatabase relationship classes (e.g., rc_vegpt_vp_clsf, rc_vegpt_vp_location, etc.). For these tables to export along with the feature class into a shapefile, they would first need to be joined to the feature class data set prior to exporting.</enttypd>
