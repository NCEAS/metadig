      <abstract>Accuracy Assessment, Observation and Plot Points. This data set includes points used to collect data for map valdiation of community types in Ozark National Scenic Riverways ONSR), Missouri. Data were collected during the growing season, 2005 from eight sites distributed throughout all 5 Landtype Associations within the Mapping Area. Also used for validation were points collected in 2003 and 2004 that were withheld from the training data set.</abstract>
      <purpose>To assist with the development of vegetation maps for the National Park Service. Plots were collected to characterize actual vegetation, while accuracy assessment plots were visited to verify the mapper's interpretation of the vegetation communities.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Some data points are missing. See completeness report.</supplinf>

    <complete>Seven plots have no associated points in the VegPoints feature class. These are AS_07_03, BS_20_03, CB1102, PM_08_18, PS194, PS205 and VBN0993. They appear to have been excluded by the GIS specialist for use as training data for undocumentated reasons. 124 AA points have no associated points in the VegPoints features class. These were excluded for a variety of reasons, some of which are unknown.</complete>
