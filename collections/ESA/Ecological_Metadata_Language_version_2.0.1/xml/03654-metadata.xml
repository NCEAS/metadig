 <abstract> <para>The purpose of this data set was to investigate the effects of habitat characteristics and urbanization on grassland butterfly diversity. We sampled butterflies at 66 sites in Boulder County Open Space in the years 1999 and 2000. We tested for effects of habitat characteristics (grassland type and quality) and landscape context (percentage surrounding urbanization) on butterfly diversity and abundance. Although both habitat characteristics did affect butterfly diversity, landscape context did not. The data contain butterfly species diversity and individual species' abundance for the five periods sampled: July 1999, August 1999, June 2000, July 2000, and August 2000. Our samples included 58 species from five butterfly families: Hesperiidae (17 species), Papilionidae (4 species), Pieridae (7 species), Lycaenidae (11 species), and Nymphalidae (19 species). These data include endangered butterfly species, as well as surveys from relictual tallgrass prairie. There is some limitation to these data, as our sampling was not exhaustive through the year. That is, many species we observed also occur outside of the time-period sampled, and some butterfly species may not have been present as adults during the months of June, July, and August, and thus were not sampled. We present these data with the hope that they be combined with future surveys using the methods described here to constitute a long-term data set. These data will undoubtedly be useful in understanding temporal changes in butterfly abundance and diversity, effects of urbanization on different taxa, and determinants of local and large-scale faunal diversity.</para>

 <geographicCoverage scope="document"> <geographicDescription>Data were collected from surveys in Boulder County Open Space grasslands, in 

Boulder, Colorado, USA. Boulder lies at the intersection of the eastern Rocky 

Mountains and the western Great Plains (40&#176;00'54"N, 105&#176;16'12"W). Boulder Open 

Space Department manages over 10,000 hectares of grassland habitat, which form 

a nearly continuous ring around the city of Boulder. The protected status of 

this open space provides an ideal setting for long-term monitoring. These 

grasslands include tallgrass remnants, mixed-grass and shortgrass prairies, and 

hayfields. We used 66 sites established by Bock and Bock (1994) for which 

vegetation data were available (Bennett 1997).</geographicDescription>

<para>Field/Laboratory: In brief, we surveyed 66 sites in Boulder County Open Space Grasslands five times over two years: twice in 1999 (July and August) and three times in 2000 (June, July, August). Sites were sampled on sunny days between 1000 and 1600 hours. We used a modified line-transect method (Pollard 1977) to survey a 200-m-diameter circle (Collinge et al 2003). Each plot was divided into four quadrants of equal area and each quadrant was surveyed for 10 minutes by a trained observer. Beginning 20 paces from the center of the plot, an observer walked over the entire area of the quadrant for 10 minutes. The first three to five individuals of each butterfly species observed were collected with butterfly nets, and stored in glassine envelopes for the voucher collection. Individuals that could not be immediately identified were collected and identified at the Entomology Collection of the University of Colorado Museum. All butterfly species and their absolute abundance were recorded. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Entomology Collection of the University of Colorado Museum.</para>
<para>This data paper documents surveys of butterfly diversity and abundance in grasslands of Boulder County, Colorado during the years 1999 and 2000. The surveys were conducted on 66 established sites in the 10,000 hectares managed by the Boulder Open Space Department (Bock and Bock 1994). These protected grassland sites are located in a green belt which surrounds the city of Boulder, Colorado, and include relictual tallgrass prairie, lowland hayfields in floodplains, and short- and mixed-grass prairies adjacent to foothill woodlands (Bock et al. 1995). These sites should remain free of development in the coming years, providing a stable study area, ideal for long-term monitoring. The data were used to analyze the effects of habitat characteristics and landscape context on grassland butterfly diversity and abundance (Collinge et al. 2003). The data set represents 7246 individuals of 58 butterfly species in 5 families. These data correspond to a majority of Boulder County grassland butterfly diversity and reflect the phenology of these species for the summer months of the two years sampled (A complete list of all butterfly species found in Boulder County can be found at the USGS Butterflies of North America web site [Opler et al. 1995]). The data set includes endangered butterfly species, as well as surveys from rare habitat types (tallgrass prairie). These data are presented with the hope that they improve our understanding of large scale determinants of local and global abundances and diversity. Although these data alone do not constitute a long-term data set (2 years) and the temporal scale is slightly coarse (monthly), by using the standard sampling techniques presented here, researchers may generate additional fine-scale (weekly) data, to constitute a long-term data set.</para>
