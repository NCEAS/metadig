<abstract><para>Indices of abundance of selected mammals were obtained for two study areas within the Great Basin: the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, Idaho, and Curlew Valley, Utah, USA.  Data collection occurred biannually 1962-1993, with varying durations among species and sites.  Abundance indices were obtained for coyotes (Canis latrans), lagomorphs (primarily black-tailed jackrabbits, Lepus californicus), and eight species of rodents.  Data were originally gathered as part of a long-term study of interactions among predator and prey populations, concentrating on aspects related to coyotes and black-tailed jackrabbits.  Secondarily, these data are useful in portraying trends in mammal abundance on these two Great Basin sites.</para>

 <geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Mammal abundance patterns in the northern portion of the Great Basin. We provide data from 2 field sites within the northern portion of the Great Basin (Fig. D1). The 700-km^2 Curlew Valley (CV) site is located in Box Elder County, Utah, with primary boundaries on the north and northwest comprised of State Highway 30, on the east by the Snowville-Locomotive Springs road, on the south by salt flats adjacent to the Great Salt Lake and on the west by the Kelton access road. Climate is described as Northern Desert Shrub Biome (Fautin 1946) and Temperate Desert Division Ecoregion (Bailey 1998) with climate data recorded at the Snowville Station of the National Climatic Data Center (NOAA 2002, http://www.noaa.org). Vegetative communities are documented by Booth (2001). About 20% of the site was subject to range fires in 1983.

Our other study site encompassed 1,225 km^2 of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), a National Environmental Research Park (NERP) located in portions of Bingham, Bonneville, Butte, Clark, and Jefferson Counties, Idaho. Located about 56 km northwest of Idaho Falls, it is situated within the northern portion of the Snake River Plain.</geographicDescription>

 <para>Indices of rodent abundance. - Trends in the abundance of various rodents were assessed via a series of rodent survey routes. Each survey route utilized 23.2 km (14.4 mi) of tertiary dirt road and consisted of 25 trapping transects located at 0.97-km (0.6 mi) intervals along and perpendicular to the route, alternately on the left and right of the road. Each transect consisted of 10 trap stations, spaced 10 m apart at which we placed 1 M-4 snap trap with an expanded treadle (Carley and Knowlton 1971). Traps were baited with a mixture of peanut butter and rolled oats and checked daily for three consecutive trap-nights. The indices of rodent abundance are expressed as "catch per unit effort,"with effort defined with the equation of Hoffman (1979), Stoddart (1987a, b), and Mills (1987) and Mills and Knowlton (1991) (more information on this at online address)</para>
 <para>We established 4 permanent rodent survey routes in CV and 6 in INEEL to assess relative rodent abundance. The attempted trapping effort in Curlew Valley was 3,000 trap-nights for each spring and fall sampling period between 1973 and 1986. On INEEL, the target trapping effort was 4,500 trap-nights each spring and fall 1975-1984.</para>
 <para>Indices of lagomorph abundance.- Black-tailed jackrabbits were common to both study sites. A series of 1.6-km square flushing transects (0.4-km per side), were located near dirt roads and trails in randomly selected survey sections, as per Gross et al.(1974). A four-foot steel post permanently defined the starting and ending point of each transect. Each transect was walked each fall and spring between 0900 and 1600 h. The right-angle distance from the transect to the flushing point of each jackrabbit observed was determined and used to calculate a density estimate from frequency distributions of perpendicular flushing distances using the Fourier series estimator in program TRANSECT (Burnham et al. 1980). Subsequently, when experimental transects conducted on horseback provided a 141% higher estimate (Wywialowski and Stoddart 1988), density estimates from the walked transects were considered indices, effectively changing the scale but not the pattern of the estimates. In CV, transects (n = 59-65) were walked 1962-1993 and in INEEL (n = 80) 1975-1986. In 1985-1986, the overall index of jackrabbit abundance in INEEL was based upon 22 lines in the northeast section of the study area.</para>
 <para>Two additional lagomorph species, mountain cottontails (Sylvilagus nuttallii), and pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis) were detected on the INEEL site. Because positive species identifications of flushed rabbits was not always accomplished, our abundance indices for these two species were combined.</para>
 <para>Indices of coyote abundance. - The methodology we used to assess relative coyote abundance changed several times as our understanding of caveats associated with each technique increased (Knowlton 1984). Ultimately, 4 independent indices contributed to our assessments of coyote abundance. We then synthesized a single index based upon results obtained as (1) catch-rates from coyote capture efforts, (2) coyote visitation rates to artificial scent stations, and (3) coyote scat deposition rates.</para>
 <para>Two catch-rate indices were initially used to assess relative coyote abundance (Clark 1972). Between 1966 and 1981, a fall index of coyote abundance was obtained for the CV site based on coyote capture rates (no. of coyotes captured/trap-night) in about 30 days of trapping effort (1,424-2,942 trap-nights, x = 1,942) with #3 Victor leg-hold traps (Clark 1972). In an effort to extend the index of relative coyote abundance in CV retrospectively, Clark (1972) examined aerial gunning records from the Utah's Animal Damage Control Program. The coyote kill-rate, in terms of the number of coyotes shot by aerial gunning teams per hour of flight in the Curlew Valley area was used to create another index of coyote abundance for 1963-1966 and thus project the coyote capture rate index backward by 3 years.</para>
