<abstract>
<para>Soil carbon (C) balances were measured in two sites, Nashua and Kanawha (Iowa, USA), to evaluate the effects of N fertilization and cropping system. The experimental design was split-plot randomized block, with cropping system in the main plot, and N fertilization (four levels: 0, 90, 180 and 270 kg ha-1) in the subplot. Both sites contained the following cropping systems: continuous corn (CC); corn-soybean (CS); and corn-corn-oats-alfalfa (CCOA). At Kanawha, the fourth cropping system was COAA; at Nashua it was continuous soybean (SS). The experimental unit was the N-fertilization sub-plot. These experiments started in 1979 at Nashua and 1954 at Kanawha. Variables measured included: inputs of organic C, decay rates of organic C, and soil organic C stocks after 23 and 48 years respectively at Nashua and Kanawha. Inputs of organic C, Aboveground plus Belowground Net Primary Productivity (ANPP plus BNPP) minus harvested grain, were determined for corn by measuring total aboveground and belowground biomass in this annual crop at maturity. Aboveground organic matter (OM) inputs were thus calculated as the sum of leaves, stalks, husks, cobs, tassels, aboveground prop roots, weeds, and detritus (current crop only). For estimates of BNPP, biomass of fine roots, belowground prop roots and belowground stem was sampled for each of five depth increments, 0-15, 15-30, 30-50, 50-85, and 85-110 cm. For soybean, oats, and alfalfa, OM inputs were estimated based on measured long-term yield data and published allometric relationships. Plant tissue samples for all crops were analyzed for C content to convert from an OM to a C basis. Organic C decay was evaluated by 1) a mass-balance approach in all cropping systems at both sites; and 2) an isotopic mixing model to assess decay rates of the C3- and C4-derived C inputs to the system in the CS system at Nashua. Soil organic C was measured in all N treatments in the corn phase of all cropping systems in 2002 during a single post-harvest sampling (in October) prior to fall tillage. Soil OC was determined for each of the following depth increments: 0-5; 5-15; 15-30; 30-50; 50-75; and 75-100 cm.</para>

<title>Measurements of organic C inputs, decay rates and soil organic C stocks under four levels of N fertilization in cropping systems in Midwestern US Mollisols</title>
<para>The soil carbon (C) balance was evaluated by measuring organic C inputs, decay rates and stocks in soil. Inputs of organic C (ANPP plus BNPP minus harvested yield) were determined for corn by measuring total aboveground and belowground biomass directly at crop maturity (~20 wk, black layer stage). Aboveground organic matter (OM) inputs were calculated as the sum of leaves, stalks, husks, cobs, tassels, aboveground prop roots, weeds, and detritus (current crop only). For estimates of BNPP, biomass of fine roots, belowground prop roots and belowground stem was sampled for each of five depth increments, 0-15, 15-30, 30-50, 50-85, and 85-110 cm. For soybean, oats, and alfalfa, (OM) inputs were estimated based on measured long-term yield data and published allometric relationships. Organic C decay was evaluated by 1) a mass-balance approach in all cropping systems at both sites; and 2) an isotopic mixing model to assess decay rates of the C3- and C4-derived C inputs to the system in the CS system at Nashua. Soil organic C was measured in all N treatments in the corn phase of all cropping systems in 2002 during a single post-harvest sampling (in October) prior to fall tillage. Soil OC was determined for each of the following depth increments: 0-5; 5-15; 15-30; 30-50; 50-75; and 75-100 cm.</para>

<para>ANPP and BNPP were measured in corn in 2001 at Nashua and 2002 at Kanawha. Average long-term yield data were for the period 1979-1998 at Nashua (Mallarino and Pecinovsky 1999) and 1984-1998 at Kanawha (Mallarino and Rueber 1999). Soil organic C data are for the year 2002. The species contained in the cropping systems were: Zea mays L., Glycine max (L.) Merr., Avena sativa L., and Medicago sativa L.</para>

<samplingDescription>
<para>For measurements of corn ANPP, two transects were sampled within each subplot at each site; each transect was the width of the crop row, 0.76 m, and the length of the sub-plot. Locations for 0.5 x 0.76-m quadrats were randomly selected and framed with PVC tubing. We harvested all of the aboveground biomass from each of the six plots per N treatment within a site, sampling a total of ~200 plants within the 48 plots in the two sites. We separated the biomass into the following components: grain, leaves, stalks, husks, cobs, tassels, aboveground prop roots, weeds, and detritus (current crop only). Losses to herbivory were minimal; hence, total aboveground biomass at maturity of this annual crop provided a measure of ANPP.

For measurements of corn BNPP, biomass of fine roots, belowground prop roots and belowground stem was sampled using a mechanical coring device equipped with an inner plastic sleeve (6.1 cm diameter). We sampled to a 110-cm depth at four positions: 1) the inter-row; 2) center of row (between plants), 3) center of row (on top of plant); and 4) the midpoint between the row center and the inter-row. To assess the assumption that root biomass at maturity represented annual root production, we had conducted a pilot study at a site in north central Iowa that contained N treatments of 67, 135 and 202 kg N ha-1. We assessed root mortality at three times during the growing season, at ages 3, 12, and 20 wk. At each sample time, the location of three quadrats (0.5 x 0.76 m) for each N treatment was randomly selected, the quadrat was framed with PVC tubing, and the entire soil mass was excavated to a depth of 0.5 m. In total, ~105 plants were sampled. The entire mass of soil and roots was soaked overnight and roots were separated from soil and detritus by hand. Roots were categorized by status (live or dead), based on morphological characteristics. Samples were dried at 65oC and weighed before calculating the proportion of dead mass. At 3, 12, and 20 wk, the mean (S.E.) dead mass was 0 (0), 8.7 (1.0), and 6.8 (0.8) % of total root mass, respectively. Root mortality rates this low at all plant ages indicated that root biomass at maturity provided a reasonable measure of annual root production. Thus, our measurement of the belowground components of corms, fine roots, and coarse roots provided an index of belowground net primary productivity (BNPP); measures of root hair production, root exudates and microbial growth, are not included in this index. 

For soybean, oats, and alfalfa, we estimated OM inputs using published allometric relationships. The conversion factors to a basis of Mg ha-1 from bushels acre-1 for corn, soybeans and oats were 0.06277, 0.06725, and 0.03583 respectively (Prince et al. 2001). For alfalfa, the conversion factor from tons acre-1 was 2.2412. The ratios for HI were 0.42, 0.52, and 1.00 and for root:shoot, 0.15, 0.40, and 0.87 respectively for soybean, oats, and alfalfa (Buyanovsky and Wagner 1997, Prince et al. 2001).

Organic C decay rates and turnover times were calculated from kt  =  I/ Ct, where Ct is soil C at time t (Mg C ha-1), I is OC inputs (Mg C ha-1 yr-1), and kt is the decay rate (yr-1, Olson 1963, Paustian et al. 1997). Organic C inputs were estimated from long-term yield data, as described above, and represent annual inputs averaged over the long term, over all phases of the rotation. Soil OC was measured as described below. Evidence of overland flow was not observed in these sites, so losses of soil by erosion were negligible.

For all soil sampling, six 4.1-cm-diameter soil cores were taken within each plot, at two points randomly selected within each of the three positions, in the center of the row, in the inter-row, and the midpoint between those two points. The subsamples within a plot were bulked by depth increment. All samples were air-dried, roots were removed, rock masses and volumes were determined, and soil was passed through a 2-mm sieve. Subsamples were dried at 105oC to determine conversion factors to a 105oC dry-weight basis.

Total soil C concentrations were analyzed by dry combustion, using the Carlo-Erba elemental analyzer described above. Total SOC was calculated as the difference between total soil C and soil inorganic C, which was measured by the modified pressure-calcimeter method (Sherrod et al. 2002).

Notes: The main tillage at Nashua was chisel plowing to a depth of 23-25 cm in the fall following corn and alfalfa (Russell et al. 2005). At Kanawha, moldboard plowing to a depth of 25 cm was the primary tillage. At both sites, secondary tillage consisted of spring disking to a depth of 8-13 cm after soybean, and in plots that had been plowed the preceding fall. At both sites, the cropping systems were tile-drained and rain-fed. The corn varieties sampled were: Golden Harvest 2390 (non BT) at Nashua in 2001; and Golden Harvest 8067 BT at Kanawha in 2002. Mean (SE) density of corn was the same in all sites: 8.1 (0.2) plants per m2. Nitrogen fertilizer was added as granulated urea in all corn phases of the rotation, in the spring immediately before disking.</para>
