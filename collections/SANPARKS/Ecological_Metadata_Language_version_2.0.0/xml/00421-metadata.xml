 <abstract><para>The &#8216;Nwashitsumbe vlei in the Kruger National Park is separated from a mopane matrix by the vlei/upland boundary. The boundary has been delineated in terms of grass species and soil characteristics, but not woody vegetation, which is an integral component of savanna ecosystems. A large exclosure provided the opportunity to study the effects of large mammalian browser exclusion on boundary dynamics and woody vegetation characteristics. The vlei/upland boundary differs from the surrounding patch types in species composition, slope, electrical conductivity and pH characteristics. Each characteristic has a slightly different spatial distribution pattern across the boundary, probably resulting from differential responses to different or the same vectors and disturbance agents. These characters should be viewed holistically as they overlap to form a complex three-dimensional boundary. Woody species distribution is more patchy than that of the grasses. Life-history strategy responses are suggested as possible causes for differences in distribution pattern. Browsing disturbance has altered the structure, composition and possibly the function of the woody vegetation boundary. This study suggests that the vlei/upland boundary is more sensitive to large mammalian herbivore impact than the surrounding patch types. Such changes and differences are of concern to managers who aim to maintain biodiversity. Current monitoring, in the Kruger National park, of woody vegetation responses to herbivore impact occurs at too coarse a scale to detect change in either the boundary or the species guild-specific responses identified in this study. It is recommended that they be used as indicators of herbivore mediated change in the landscape.</para>

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Assessing temporal change in percentage aerial cover of woody vegetation</title>
 <para>Aerial photographs from 1987 and 2001 were used to assess temporal changes, resulting from the exclusion of large herbivores, in the percentage aerial cover of woody vegetation. The photographs were taken in June and May respectively so little variation due to seasonality would have occurred. The 1987 photograph was chosen for analysis as it was taken a few months after the exclosure was extended into the vlei.</para>
 <para>Photographs of the 2 study sites (inside and outside of the exclosure) from each year were enlarged to the same scale using ArcView. A grid containing 1mm X 1mm squares was placed over each site. Each square represented 16m2 on the ground. Squares with more than 50% woody vegetation cover were recorded to gain an estimate of the percentage aerial cover of woody vegetation.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>5.2.1 Environmental variables and vegetation characteristics</title>
 <para>Line transects were placed inside and outside of the exclosure to detect differences in vegetation and environmental variables resulting from the exclusion of large herbivores. Transects started in the deepest channel of the vlei and ran up the horizontal slope, perpendicular to the vlei, until homogenous stands of Colophospermum mopane (a recognised upland species) were encountered. The same transect placement pattern as Kroger used was used in this study to permit comparisons with his study of the boundary as defined by grass species distribution. Transects were placed in a stratified manner, moving away from the exclosure fence in opposite directions, with the gap between transects increasing by 50m each time.</para>
 <para>The stratified placement was originally used in Kroger&#8217;s study to capture the gradient of grazing away from the water holes on either side of the fence. Five transects inside and five transects outside of the exclosure covered a significant proportion of the vlei and were all that time allowed.  Inside the exclosure, the stratified placement used by Kroger could not be followed exactly as area of woody vegetation was cleared in the upland for game release/capture. An extra transect was placed between transects four and five to compensate.</para>
 <para>Sampling was conducted at a fine scale; every 2.5m along each transect, to detect small changes in vegetation and environmental variables and aid in boundary detection.</para>
 <para>A theodolite was used to measure both vertical and horizontal distance every 2.5m along each transect so that slope could be accurately determined.</para>
 <para>Soil was collected from the top 15cm of the profile with a soil auger. Samples were placed in plastic bags to avoid moisture loss, weighed, oven dried at 80&#186;C until constant mass was achieved and then weighed again. Percentage soil moisture was determined from a wet soil mass versus dry soil mass calculation. Samples were mixed in distilled water (one part soil : three parts water) with an electric grinder for one minute. The electrical conductivity (mS) and pH of this solution were measured with a HANNA (H1-991301) electronic meter.</para>
 <para>Contiguous plots along transects remain the most effective technique for providing baseline system descriptions along gradients (Olsvig-Whittaker 1988) and quadrats that are much wider than they are long, are sensitive to boundary detection (Fortin 1999). Woody vegetation was, therefore, sampled in 2.5m X 20m contiguous quadrats.  Species, height and stem circumference were recorded for each woody plant occurring in a quadrat. Tree height was measured with a ranging rod and a tape measure was used to determine stem circumference. A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test was used to test differences in height and stem diameter class distributions inside and outside of the exclosure.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Determination of environmental variable-species associations</title>
 <para>Species distribution is determined by a number of complex interrelated factors. A direct canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to establish the relationship between environmental variables and species distribution across the vlei/upland boundary (Canoco for Windows Ver.4). Grouping species according to their environmental preferences can aid the identification of patches and therefore boundaries in a landscape. Slope, elevation, horizontal distance, longitudinal distance, pH, electrical conductivity, percentage soil moisture and were used in the analysis as they were considered possible determinants of woody species distribution.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Identifying discontinuities in the environment</title>
 <para>Boundaries are locations where the rates or magnitudes of ecological transfers change abruptly in relation to those within the surrounding patch types (Harrod 1988). Boundaries can therefore be identified though discontinuities or regions of high variation in environmental or vegetation characteristics. Locations of high variance can be determined using a moving split-window technique (Ludwig &amp;mp;amp; Cornelis 1987).</para>
 <para>Window size refers to the number of samples or quadrats for which a change in variance is evaluated. The mean for each half-window is subtracted from the mean of the other half-window to determine variance between the two-half windows in terms of Euclidean distance. The window is then moved one quadrat or sample point along a transect and the process repeated until the entire transect has been sampled. Various half-window sizes were experimented with. A size of three quadrats or sample points (i.e. 7.5m) was selected for the scale of the study.</para>
 <para>Euclidean distance = &#61654;   &#61669; {((x1+ x2+ x3)/3) &#8211; ((x4+ x5+ x6)/3)} 2</para>
 <para>The Euclidean distance measure for slope, pH, electrical conductivity, soil moisture and the frequency of woody species occurrence was plotted against distance from the vlei for each transect. Consistently low variance values indicate areas of relative homogeneity or patches. Peaks in Euclidean distance, however, indicate areas of high variation and, therefore, boundaries. Small peaks in Euclidean distance represent small-scale background variance in the data (Ludwig &amp;mp;amp; Cornelis 1987). Larger peaks were used to identify the number and locations of boundaries for each variable.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>2 Representing boundaries spatially</title>
 <para>Spatial representation of boundaries is essential for the identification of environmental variable-vegetation relationships and differences arising from large mammalian herbivore exclusion.</para>
 <para>The boundary locations for each variable were linked across all ten transects to provide a spatial representation of boundary position, relative to the vlei and firebreak road that runs roughly parallel to the vlei.</para>

 <sampling><studyExtent><description><para>3.1 &#8216;Nwashitsumbe vlei and exclosure

The &#8216;Nwashitsumbe vlei occurs on the Northern Plains of the Kruger National Park (S22&#176;431-S22&#176;591; E31&#176;121-E31&#176;221) and lies on a flat basaltic landscape. The upland areas are dominated by Mopane/Combretum woodland. Grasses dominate the low-lying, seasonally inundated vlei. The &#8216;Nwashitsumbe exclosure was constructed in 1968 and extended into the vlei in 1986. It currently encloses 309 hectares. All browsers have been excluded from the upland for 33 years and from the vlei/upland boundary for 15 years. The average fire return period has been 4.3 years inside the exclosure and 4 years outside (Trollope et. al. 1998).</para>
