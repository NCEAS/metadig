<abstract><para>In Africa, insectivorous birds have been shown to have higher foraging rate and capture success when in the presence of herbivores, particularly elephants. As elephants also forage past sunset, it is possible that microchiropterans take advantage of the disturbances elephants cause while foraging. This foraging flushes insects out into the open for predation. However, this potential ecological interaction has received little attention in past studies. This study examined the effect that elephants have on Microchiroptera activity and compared our findings to previous studies conducted during the dry season. In order to assess bat activity, we located foraging elephants and recorded bat calls around them. The bats recorded were mostly open-air bats and a few clutter-edge bats. Too few clutter bats were found to perform statistical analysis. Studies during the wet season show no significant difference in bat activity in the presence or absence of elephants. However, during the dry season, there is significantly more clutter and clutter-edge bat activity in the presence of elephants than in the control recordings. In addition, there is a higher level of clutter and clutter-edge bat activity, in the presence of elephants, during the dry season than in the wet season. Microchiropteran-elephant commensal relationships are seasonal and increase during the dry season, when prey species are not as accessible. Bats are often considered important indicators of environmental stability, and research like this can provide information on the health of the ecosystem. Furthermore, studying their interactions with elephants can help in the ongoing controversy regarding elephants and the potential stress and instability they cause in the environment. In addition, as bird-elephant commensalism is well-understood as an important ecological interaction, it is possible that bat-elephant commensalism is equally important among nocturnal organisms.</para>

<para>Study Sites</para>
<para>We collected 9 recordings of bat activity around elephants, most of which were sighted along the Sabie River, near the Skukuza camp in Kruger National Park. One recording was collected in a riverine landscape characterized by riparian forest. The other recordings took place in shrubveld vegetation characterized by Acacia nigrescens and Dichrostachys cinerea (Venter et al. 2003). All recordings occurred during the wet season, in November 2009.</para>
<para>These data were combined with the data from previous years&#8217; study in early-mid September. The previous years&#8217; data were collected in similar locations as the sites described above; however, their collection took place mainly along the Sabie and Shingwedzi River system and occurred during the dry season. The previous years&#8217; data had one of the five observations take place in the riparian vegetation type. The remaining four observations took place in the shrubveld vegetation along the roadside (Clements et al. 2008).</para>
<para>Experimental Procedure</para>
<para>At night, just prior to sundown, elephants or other megaherbivores would be located in close enough proximity to the road for ultrasonic detection. The number of individuals was recorded, as well as the species. For each selected elephant individual or herd, a GPS location and time would be noted, as well as general environmental characteristics: temperature, wind speed, and vegetation. The bat calls were detected using a Petterson Ultrasound Detector D240x (Petterson Elektronic AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The detector was set to time-expansion mode (in order to detect the entire spectrum of ultrasonic frequencies) with an automatically recording trigger and a memory size of 1.7 seconds. These calls were subsequently recorded using a Zoom H2 Handy Recorder (Zoom Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The ultrasound detector and recorder were held and oriented towards the elephants, maintaining a consistent upward angle. Though the detection range was limited, the vehicle followed herbivores as necessary to maintain a fairly constant distance, and recording was cancelled once they moved too far out of range. Recordings took place for either a maximum of ten minutes or until the herbivores moved too far from the road to follow.</para>
<para>Each megaherbivore recording was paired with one control. These control sites were established in the same areas once the elephants moved out of range. However, in some cases control sites could not be recorded until the subsequent day due to continued elephant activity and time constraints. In these cases, we replicated the elephant recording locations as closely as possible by recording at the same time and location under similar conditions. Characteristics of these control areas were recorded, and data collection took place for the same length of time as the associated megaherbivore recording to maintain a standard between control and experimental plots.</para>
<para>The program BatSound Pro (Version 3.31b Petterson Elektronic AB) was utilized to identify key characteristics: lengths and numbers of call events, peak frequencies, and the presence of feeding buzzes. Following this, feeding guilds were assigned to the bat calls based on these characteristics. These data were both compared with and supplemented with data from identical study in previous years, during the dry season, in order to test the effect of seasonality (Clements et al. 2008, Aung et al. 2007, Barnhill et al. 2006).</para>
<para>Data Analysis</para>
<para>To assess whether elephants had any impact on bat activity, a Wilcoxon paired test was used to determine if any significant difference existed between experimental and control recordings. The Wilcoxon test was used because the data dealt with counts and not a gradient, and thus the data were not normal; a paired test was utilized because bat activity was measured at the same location with and without elephants. The test also determined if there was any difference in bat activity among the guilds as well.</para>
<para>Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to analyze the differences in bat-elephant interactions between seasons and within guilds. These tests were utilized both due to our non-normal data and because seasonal variation called for non-paired tests to compare bat activity. All statistical analyses were performed using the program STATISTICA (Version 6.1 StatSoft, Inc.).</para>
