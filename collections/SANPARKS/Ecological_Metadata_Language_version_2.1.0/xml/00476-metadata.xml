<abstract><para>An open-access article in the journal Koedoe introducing and describing the supersites can be downloaded from:

http://www.koedoe.co.za/index.php/koedoe/article/viewFile/1107/1488

This article is accompanied by an online appendix providing further useful information regarding the supersites (see below), which can be downloaded from:

http://www.koedoe.co.za/index.php/koedoe/article/viewFile/1107/1480

In the article the following information is provided:
&#8226;	Rational for supersites
&#8226;	Selection criteria for supersites
&#8226;	Process followed for selecting supersites
&#8226;	Management of supersites and management of research projects on supersites
&#8226;	Data access for supersites

Furthermore, the following background data and description for each supersite is provided:
&#8226;	Map showing location, drainage network, and access routes
&#8226;	Phenology/seasonality
&#8226;	Long-term average:
o	Rainfall
o	Herbivore biomass (per feeding guild)
o	Herbaceous biomass
o	Woody cover
o	Fire history

In addition, the online appendix provides the following information:
&#8226;	Morphometric features of land types in which supersites occur
&#8226;	Landforms, soils and dominant vegetation associated with the landsystems in which the supersites occur
&#8226;	Hydrogeological characteristics for the regions within which the supersites occur
&#8226;	Annual rainfall for the supersites since 1940
&#8226;	Historical average herbivore density for supersites (per species)
&#8226;	Job-row-image codes for historical NGI (formerly CD:SM) aerial photography
&#8226;	Aerial and ground photos for supersites (examples)
&#8226;	Maps, showing supersites in relation to park-wide:
o	Infrastructure (roads and camps)
o	Long-term average annual rainfall
o	Physiographic zones
o	Geology
o	Altitude and large rivers
o	Mean annual A-pan equivalent evaporation
o	Long-term fire return period
o	Woody cover
o	Herbivore (grazer, browser, mixed feeder and total herbivore) biomass
o	Long-term dry-season elephant density
o	Site locations and site identification numbers of Venter (1990) and VCA surveys on our within 5 km from supersites.</para>
