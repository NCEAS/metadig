 <abstract><para>As seasons change so do the characteristics of plants, such as amount foliage and density of grasses, which affects the populations of mammals dependent on the food and cover provided by the vegetation.  By comparing data collected between 14 and 16 September 2009 to previously collected data between 11 and 14 April 2009, we were able to explore the effect of seasonality on small mammal populations within three study zones in Mapungubwe National Park, South Africa.  The three study zones represented three different habitats and were a camp dominated by man-made structures interspersed with Mopane trees, an open grassy area with some shrub cover, and a cliff area consisting of bare rock face and grass cover.  Comparison of the data revealed a significant drop in abundance of rodents in the winter at the human disturbed and grassy sites but not in the rocky site.  It was also noted that although abundance decreased overall from winter to summer, both species diversity and richness increased.  Finally, differences in community structure were noted, in particular an increase from summer to winter in Mastomys natalensis and Tatera leucogaster.  Possible explanations for these differences involve a combination of: (1) differences in vegetative cover brought on my changes in season; (2) food scarcity bringing out trap shy rodents; (3) a decrease in inter-species competition due to decreased species dominance in winter.</para>

 <para>Study site</para>
 <para>The location of this study was in Mapungubwe National Park, Limpopo Province South Africa.  We resurveyed sites based on the work conducted between 11 and 14 April 2009 by Breed et al. The study zones were described as Leokwe Rest Camp (Figures 1a and 1b) (S22&#186;13.056&#8217;;E29&#186;21.846&#8217;); Mopane Bushveld (Figure 2) (S22&#186;12.909&#8217;;E29&#186;21.819&#8217;); and the Rocky Outcrops (Figure 3) (S22&#186;13.002&#8217;;E29&#186;21.941&#8217;)).  The Leokwe Rest Camp was a human establishment consisting of chalets and dirt roads transecting an arid open savanna interspersed with Mopane trees.  Even though Mopane Bushveld was also an arid open savanna scattered with Mopane trees, it differed from the Rest Camp as it lacked any human disturbances and was dominated by Acacia tortilis, Acacia nigrescens and Combrium apiculatas.  The final site, the Rocky Outcrops, was bare rock-face patchily covered with grass and a few dispersed shrubs and trees (Boscia albitrunca and Crotan gratissusi).  A common feature of all three study sites was their sandstone substrate.</para>

 <para>Trapping</para>
 <para>We used a total of 90 Sherman&#169; live traps, 30 at each study site, in our experiment.  Each site had 24 large traps and six small traps laid out in three rows ten meters apart. In the Leokwe Rest Camp the traps were laid out in three parallel rows, two on either side of the main road (Figure 1a) and one in the valley behind the swimming pool (Figure 1b).  It is important to note that while the row behind the swimming pool was still considered a part of the Leokwe Rest Camp, the area probably experienced fewer disturbances. Similar parallel layouts were used in the other two sites.  The traps were partially concealed (under grass, trees, shrubs, logs) and additional vegetation was placed on top of the traps.  The vegetation provided additional cover and shading and to reduce the amount of direct sunlight hitting the trap.</para>
 <para>The traps were first laid out on the 13th of September 2009 and were baited in the evening and closed during the day. The staple ingredients of the bait were peanut butter and oats.  In order to achieve the ideal consistency&#8212;being able to be rolled into balls with a diameter of 2.5cm&#8212;additional oil and golden syrup were added to the mixture. This baiting was completed on the 13th, 14th, and 15th of November, starting at 16:30 and was finished by 17:30.  The traps were checked the next mornings at 06:30.  Every trap was emptied and closed by 08:00 to ensure no rodents would be captive during the hottest parts of the day.</para>
 <para>After capture, rodents were scruffed in cloth bags and the following measurements were taken:  sex, identification using Smithers&#8217; Mammals of Southern Africa and The mammals of the southern African subregion, weight, as well as measurements of body length and tail length.  In order to manage recaptures, we took a photograph of each new individual and gave them a unique marking with a black permanent marker (Apendix A). Rodents were released at the trap in which they were caught.</para>
 <para>Structural Habitat Analysis</para>
 <para>In each of the three sites, ten 4x4 meter plots, 20 meters apart, were used to determine percent grass cover and visibility.  Data from each plot was averaged to account for variation and to give an overall site description. To measure visibility, we performed a vegetative profile analysis. One member of the team placed his head 10cm off of the ground while another member vertically dragged a binder away from the observer.  When the observer could no longer see 50% of the binder, the distance was recorded.</para>
 <para>Statistical Analysis</para>
 <para>We analyzed our data using 2008 Microsoft Excel Version 12.1.0 to calculate total populations, calculate averages, and perform chi-square tests.  Total populations were broken up by species and capture location and used to determine site popularity by species.  Species richness, abundance, diversity (Shannon-Weiner diversity index), and an MDS diagram were created using Primer 5 version 5.1.2 (2000).  Species richness, abundance, and diversity were found by site.  These same stats were drawn from summer, 2009, using population estimates from Breed et al 2009.  Chi-square tests were used to compare winter and summer date and determine significant differences.  The MDS diagram was used to compare site and season clusters.  For grass cover data, we used information collected by Chetty et al 2009.  This data was compared with our collected data from winter, 2009 to assist in making conclusions about changes in vegetative structure.</para>
