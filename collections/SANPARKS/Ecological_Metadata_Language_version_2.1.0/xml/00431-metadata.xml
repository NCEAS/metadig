 <dataset> <title>The role of human-provisioned resources in determining the ecology and population dynamics of Moreau&#8217;s House Gecko (Hemidactylus mabouia) within the Punda Maria tourist camp in the Kruger National Park, South Africa</title>

 <abstract><para>Commensalism with humans has advantaged many animals, including Hemidactylus mabouia which has spread in association with human settlements. What factors or resources increase fitness for H. mabouia in association with humans? We sampled populations of commensal H. mabouia geckos inside the Punda Maria rest camp in the Kruger National Park and compared body condition and abundance with populations of the same species sampled outside the camp. Association with humans resulted in greater densities supported in campsite buildings and body condition was improved. Insect presence was confirmed to be positively related to proximity to light source and thus prey abundance was enhanced compared with geckos outside the rest camp. Body condition variability in the human-associated population was best explained by bite force controlled for body size; we found no significant role for measured environmental variables. No evidence for sexual dimorphism was obtained and in contrast to current knowledge no evidence of male territoriality was found. Since tail loss was equal in males and females, this was ascribed to predation rather than territoriality.</para>

<para>Study site and species</para>
<para>Moreau&#8217;s Tropical House Gecko (Hemidactylus mabouia) was sampled for three days from 11 to 13 September 2010 around the Punda Maria campsite, KNP, South Africa. The campsite is located in the more arid north of the KNP, with a mean annual precipitation of 532 mm (Venter et al. 2003). The underlying geology is complex and unique to the park, overlain by. mopane woodland (Colophospermum mopane) which dominates the vegetation (Venter et al. 2003). In order to compare human-associated geckos with those found outside settlements, two study regions were delineated: nine sites (comprising three campsite bathrooms, three kitchens, a laundry, a restaurant and petrol station) within the rest camp [31.018130S; -22.691900E] and two sites outside the camp [31.03818S; -22.70517E]. The body mass of our test species ranged from 1.14 grams &#8211; 5.8 grams.</para>
<para>Experimental protocol</para>
<para>Three sessions of active searching of approximately three hours were conducted outside the camp to sample wild populations of H. mabouia. Nighttime active searching took place for three consecutive evenings and consisted of two phases.</para>
<para>Phase 1: two evenings were spent actively searching for two hours from 20h00 to 22h00 with the intention to capture, measure and mark individuals within and outside camp buildings. We measured snout-vent length (SVL) in mm (sensu Quinn and Jones 1974), head width (mm), head height (mm) and head length (mm) using a digital caliper. Mass (g) was determined using a 30 g Pesola scale. Tail status (intact, lost or regrown), scarring and injuries were noted and anecdotally recorded. Geckos were sexed based on the presence or absence of eggs: females of H. mabouia generally carry eggs throughout the year (Branch 1998). Geckos were uniquely numbered at each site on their dorsal surface using a permanent pen before release. Behavioural observations were conducted on the first evening. We drew ten 1 x 1 m chalk quadrats around seven light sources and observed insect abundance and gecko location within the quadrats at 5 minute intervals.</para>
<para>Phase 2: a two hour &#8220;recapture&#8221; period (again between 20h00 and 22h00) took place on the third evening. New individuals were captured, measured and marked as for phase 1, already marked individuals were not recaptured. Predetermined abiotic variables were recorded in association with each individual, whether previously marked or not, including distance to nearest light source (cm), distance to nearest refuge (cm), spot surface temperature (&#8304;C) and insect presence or absence within a 50 cm radius.</para>
<para>Data analyses</para>
<para>Individuals with a SVL of less than 45mm were classified as juveniles and discarded from further analysis to ensure only fully grown individuals were used for body condition analyses. An index of body condition was created by dividing body mass by SVL. Bite force may act as a proxy for feeding ability and was considered likely to allometrically scale with SVL. That is, as body length increased, so would head area. Bite force was calculated as the product of head width and head length in mm2.. As SVL was a component of body condition, bite force was controlled for the scaling effect of increased body length by dividing bite force by SVL.</para>
<para>Tests of assumptions and statistical and graphical analyses were performed in Statistica 9.0 (StatSoft Inc. 2009). Differences in  variables between sexes and between individuals with and without tail loss histories were tested with Student&#8217;s t tests. Differences in  variables between sample sites were tested using a single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA, test statistic F). The strength of the relationship between two continuous variables was tested using Pearson&#8217;s product moment correlation (correlation coefficient r). A general linear model (GLM) was run to test how temperature , distance to nearest light source , distance to nearest refuge , bite force controlled for SVL and  insect presence affected  body condition.</para>
