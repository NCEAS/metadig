<abstract><para>Riparian ecosystems are characterised by a greater heterogeneity of vegetation structure and composition relative to other savanna communities.   However, it is contested which characteristics of the vegetation are most important for predicting bird diversity.   The aim of our study was to determine the relative importance of composition and structural complexity, in terms of variance in vertical and horizontal structure, as well as canopy cover and tree height, as predictors of bird diversity.   Bird diversity was analysed in terms of species richness, abundance, feeding and foraging guilds.   We examined eight sites of varying structural and compositional diversities along the Limpopo River in Mapungubwe National Park, South Africa.</para>

<para>Site</para>
<para>All data were collected from 14 Sept &#8211; 16 Sept 2009 along the Limpopo river riparian zone, 22&#61616;11&#8217;26.21&#8221;S, 29&#61616;22&#8217;23.67&#8221;E, Mapungubwe National Park (MNP), Limpopo Province, South Africa (Figure 1).  MNP is situated in the North-East corner of South Africa, in the junction between Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa.  This is a semi-arid landscape with varied geology, including archean rocks, metamorphics, karoo sandstone/conglomerate uplands, and alluvium and sands (Mapungubwe 2006).  A variety of soils are represented, although sandy, lime-rich soils generally deeper than 750 mm are dominant (Mapungubwe 2006).  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 350 &#8211; 400 mm and free water surface evaporation exceeds 2.5 m per year.  Rainfall is highly variable (Mapungubwe 2006).  While most rain falls in the summer months, where temperatures can reach 45 &#176;C, there are extended periods of below average rainfall (Mapungubwe 2006).</para>

<para>Bird diversity sampling was conducted in the 8 sites studied in September 2009. These sites were selected for vegetation structure in terms of canopy cover and the presence or absence of shrubs and tall trees (Table 1).</para>

<para>Bird surveys</para>
<para>Data were collected daily between 6:00 to 9:30 and between 16:30 and 18:00.  All eight sites were sampled in the morning every day, and each site was sampled only once in the evening.  The order in which sites were sampled varied between days to control for varying activity levels during particular times of the day.</para>
<para>The point-count method was used to sample bird diversity within each site.  Individuals heard or seen within a 50 m radius around a point were recorded as &#8216;in&#8217; the sampling site, while individuals between 50 m to 100 m of that point were recorded as &#8216;out&#8217; of the sampling site.  Additionally, birds flying over head were also counted as out.  Ten minutes were allocated to sampling bird diversity in each site.  Five minutes were spent recording birds in the centre of the circle, while five minutes were spent flushing (including two minutes walking into and out of the sampling site and three minutes flushing within the site).</para>
<para>Guilds</para>
<para>Birds sampled were divided up into both dietary and foraging guilds based on their diet (Table 2) and foraging (Table 3) methods respectively.  Information on diet and feeding behaviour was obtained from Roberts Birds of Southern Africa (Hockey et al., 2006).</para>

<para>Carnivore	Primarily consumes non-insect animals</para>
<para>Frugivore	Primarily consumes fruit</para>
<para>Granivore	Primarily consumes seeds and nuts</para>

<para>Canopy	Primarily search for food in upper, middle or lower canopy, or a mixture of these.  Does not include birds which perch as a vantage point for hunting.</para>
<para>Midstory	Primarily search for food in midstory or understory.  Does not include birds which perch and swoop.</para>
<para>Perch and Hunt	Primarily search for food by perch and swoop, hawk or dive.  Does not include birds which hunt aerially and consume prey on the perch</para>
<para>Aerial	Hunt aerially and consume prey on perch</para>
<para>Ground Closed	Primarily search for food on ground, either in soil, grass, or leaf litter clear of any midstory.</para>
<para>Ground Open	Primarily search for food on ground, either in soil, grass, or leaf litter under a midstory</para>
<para>Generalist	Search for food in more than one guild</para>
<para>Birds that were counted as &#8216;out&#8217; were not included, and birds that do not rely on terrestrial structure as part of their foraging behaviour, such as Red-Billed Oxpecker, African Darter, Blacksmith lapwing, Brown-throated martin, and Grey Heron, were excluded.</para>
<para>Data analysis</para>
<para>All data collected on bird diversity in September 2009 were combined with the data collected in April 2009 by Jones et al (unpublished). The bird count data was used to calculate Bray-Curtis similarities between sites (site 1 and 2, 1 and 3, etc.) in PRIMER (Primer-E Ltd., 2001).  The Bray-Curtis index is a descriptive measure of general similarity in species assemblages at different sites and is only weakly affected by rare species (Krebs, 1999).  Two-dimensional Multi-Dimensional Scaling ordinations (MDS plots) were generated, visually demonstrating similarities between sites as distances on the plot.   The classification of sites based on woody vegetation structure was mapped onto the MDS. To test whether the composition of a bird assemblage at a site is related to its position along the River, the Bray-Curtis similarity value for each pair of sites was correlated with geographical distance between each pair.</para>
<para>Simpson&#8217;s index (Ds) of bird diversity was calculated in PRIMER.  Simpson&#8217;s index is one of standard ways to measure diversity and puts more weight on the evenness than the richness of species in the samples (Krebs, 1999).  It is therefore suitable for a study of general ecosystem function like the one conducted.  The index has comparatively small errors with small sample sizes, which makes it useful for a study with a limited number of counts (Routledge 1980).</para>
<para>Average percentage aerial canopy cover estimate was calculated for each site using Microsoft Office Excel software (Microsoft 2002).  The diversity of vertical vegetation layers was estimated using Ds.  Diversity was calculated treating each vegetation layer as a morphospecies and the value representing how filled a particular layer was treated as the number of individuals in the morphospecies.  An MDS was plotted to demonstrate similarities in woody plant assemblages between the sites and Ds for diversity in woody species was calculated.</para>
<para>To analyze the dependence of bird diversity on vegetation structure, the values of Ds for bird diversity were regressed against Simpson&#8217;s index of structural diversity, large tree density (no of trees/site), basal area (cm2) and the percentage canopy cover (%).  A similar analysis was done to test if floristics drive bird diversity.  Ds values for bird assemblages were regressed against Ds indices for woody plants.  In addition, the Bray-Curtis similarity in bird assemblages was regressed against the similarity in floristics.</para>
<para>The same steps (MDS and regression against structure and floristics characteristics) were taken to analyze the relationship between the diversity in dietary guilds and foraging guilds.</para>
