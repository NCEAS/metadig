 <abstract><para>Some pollinating fig wasp males fight each other for access to females and there is a
suite of morphological characters that can be used to predict whether a male fig wasp
will fight or not. This experiment tested out the validity of using morphological
characters to predict fighting behavior by examining the morphology and observing
the behavior of male fig wasps in Ficus sycomorus synconia. Males of each species
present in the sycamore figs were examined and their fighting behavior was predicted
and then observed. The presence or absence of fighting behavior was correctly
predicted for three out of the four species found in the figs, suggesting that fighting
syndrome morphology is a good indicator of wasp fighting behavior.
Samevatting: Party betstuiwingde vy-perdeby mannetjies baklei met mekaar vir toegang aan vyperdeby
wyfies en daar is &#329; reeks morfologiese karakters wat verbriuk kan word om
te voorspel as &#329; mannetjie sal baklei of nie. Hierdie eksperiment toets die geldigheid
van die verbruik vanaf morfologiese karakters om geveg gedrag te voorspel deur die
ondersoek van morfologie en waarneeming van die gedrag van die mannetjie vyperdeby
in Ficus sycomorus synconia. Mannetjies van elke spesies wat in die vye
gevind is, was geondersoek, hul geveg gedrag was gevoorspel en waargeneem. Die
afwesigheid of teenwoordigheid van die geveg gedrag was korrek voorgespel vir drie
van die vier spesies van vy-perdebye species wat deel van die eksperiment was. Dit
suggereer dat geveg morfologie &#329; goeie aanwyser van perdeby geveg gedrag is.</para>

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><para>This experiment was conducted from 23-25 February 2004 at the Skukuza camp in Kruger</para>
 <para>National Park, Mpumalanga Province South Africa. Ficus sycomorus trees in and around the Skukuza</para>
 <para>camp were located, the stage of development of the chalcidoid wasps inside the figs was determined,</para>
 <para>and two trees were found that contained wasps at the fourth or male development stage where mature</para>
 <para>males emerge from their galls, mate with females, and chew an exit hole out of synconia (Galil et al.</para>
 <para>1968). Ten figs were collected from each of the trees.</para>
 <para>The synconia were bisected with a scalpel and five figs in which males had already emerged</para>
 <para>or were beginning to emerge in large numbers were selected. The female wasps had not yet begun to</para>
 <para>emerge from their galls. One specimen of each species of male found inside the fig was removed and</para>
 <para>examined to determine if the males had any of the traits that are associated with fighting males,</para>
 <para>including: sickle-shaped mandibles, large head, long antennal scape, antennae not projecting forward,</para>
 <para>pronotum broader than long, mesonotum, metanotum and propodeum strongly fused (Greeff et al.</para>
 <para>2003) (Table 1). After assessing the presence or absence of these traits, I predicted whether the males</para>
 <para>from the different species would fight. Tentative male species identifications were made using the</para>
 <para>Galil and Eisikowitch 1968 paper on the biology of the wasps found in the synconia of F. sycomorus</para>
 <para>trees in East Africa.</para>
 <para>One half of the synconia was placed in a small petri dish, covered with plastic wrap to prevent</para>
 <para>desiccation, and allowed to sit undisturbed for 30 minutes to one hour. The males were then observed</para>
 <para>for any displays of fighting behavior such as pushing a male away from a female, fighting with clear</para>
 <para>exchanges of bites and displacement of the resident male, biting another&#8217;s head, picking up a male and</para>
 <para>throwing him to the side, attacking a male&#8217;s thorax from the bottom, or antennae grabbing and pushing</para>
 <para>(Greeff et al. 2003). Each fig was observed for 30 minutes and the presence and type of fighting</para>
 <para>behavior displayed were recorded. Species that did not show any fighting behavior during the</para>
 <para>observation period were considered to not be fighters.</para>
