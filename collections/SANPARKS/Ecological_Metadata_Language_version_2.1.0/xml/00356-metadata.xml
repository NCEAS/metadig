 <abstract><para>Herpetofauna diversity encompasses a range of environmental habitats from fossorial to
aquatic to arboreal, linking the richness and abundance of herpetofauna community
assemblages to characteristics in vegetation and habitat structure. Many herpetofauna
species rely upon restricted (i.e. micro-habitat) components within their environment.
The aims of this study are: 1) to determine if there are differences in herpetofauna
diversity between riparian forest and xeric savanna habitat types; 2) to determine which
habitat characteristics define the species assemblages and; 3) to assess the accuracy of the
118
herpetofauna sampling methodology. Fieldwork was conducted within Mapungubwe
National Park (MNP) located in the Limpopo Province. The structure of the habitat types
were assessed along 50m transects for the following characteristics; vegetation height
(cm), soil penetration (pressure per cm^2), proximity to rock outcrop (m), woody debris,
live trees, burrows, and rocks. Species richness (S), abundance (N) and diversity (H&#8217;)
within each habitat type were analyzed as well as habitat structure and put into specific
species guilds. Overall our results showed that herpetofauna species richness was
significantly different when comparing between riparian forest and xeric savanna habitat
types.</para>

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><para>Fieldwork was conducted within Mapungubwe National Park (MNP) located in</para>
 <para>the Limpopo Province during the dates of the eleventh to the nineteenth of November.</para>
 <para>Trapping was carried out in the summer season to optimize catch rates of Herpetofauna.</para>
 <para>Two habitat types were selected for the installation of ten trap site arrays; five were</para>
 <para>placed in riparian habitats and five were placed in xeric savanna (Table A). The riparian</para>
 <para>habitat type is characterized by its&#8217; close proximity to the Limpopo River, the presence of</para>
 <para>large trees which provided a closed canopy, a more patchy undergrowth cover and a</para>
 <para>sparse ground cover. The dominant woody vegetation is composed of Acacia</para>
 <para>xanthophloea, Faidherbia aldiba, Ficus sycomorus and Xanthocercis zambesiaca, while</para>
 <para>the understory is made up of patches of shrub vegetation dominated by Croton</para>
 <para>megalobotrys (0.5m to 2.5m). The soil within this habitat has a high clay content giving it</para>
 <para>a grey colour as well as a high organic material component. Conversely, the xeric</para>
 <para>savanna ecotype was characterized as having a patchy distribution of vegetation, both</para>
 <para>ground cover and canopy cover, which was dominated by Boscia albitrunca,</para>
 <para>Colophospermum mopane, Combretum mossambicense, Commiphora glandulosa and</para>
 <para>Dichrostachys cinerea. Sites were in close proximity to sand stone outcroppings which</para>
 <para>shared approximately 50 % of the landscape. The soil within this habitat type consists of</para>
 <para>120</para>
 <para>fine grain red sand with low organic materials. Elevation between sites ranged from 504</para>
 <para>to 513 meters (m) within the riparian habitat and from 521 to 538 within the savanna</para>
 <para>habitat. Distances between trap sites within each habitat type were approximately</para>
 <para>500m.</para>
 <para>Herpetofauna sampled</para>
 <para>The herpetofauna (amphibians and reptiles grouped together) sampled during this</para>
 <para>survey were analyzed as three separate groups; herpetofauna, amphibians and reptiles</para>
 <para>combined and; amphibians and reptiles as separate groups. Each of the ten sites contained</para>
 <para>a trap array, consisting of three arms of drift fencing, four pitfall and six funnel traps</para>
 <para>(Figure 1). All trap arrays were constructed from three ten meter drift fences of black</para>
 <para>damp-proofing plastic (30 cm X 40 m) stapled to stakes and with one-third of its width</para>
 <para>buried. Pitfall traps (plastic buckets) were buried flush with the ground at the end of each</para>
 <para>drift fence (4 in total). Two different size buckets were used, ten 20 litre (centre) and</para>
 <para>thirty 9 litre (at ends of each arm). Vegetation from each site and cardboard was used to</para>
 <para>provide shade for specimens caught in the pitfall traps, while still allowing access to the</para>
 <para>trap. We used a new technique to construct funnel traps from a single sheet of green</para>
 <para>mosquito mesh and with a flat base provided more stability for traps to remain flush</para>
 <para>against each side of each drift fence were. Zippers were also installed in the top of each</para>
 <para>trap to facilitate easier specimen removal. These funnel traps were also covered with</para>
 <para>vegetation to provide shade for captured specimens. Trap arrays were checked once per</para>
 <para>day and both types of trap were successful in collecting small mammals (rodents) and</para>
 <para>invertebrates (insects, scorpions and arachnids). All captured specimens were identified</para>
 <para>to species level, classified as adult or juvenile and released 10 metres from the trap array.</para>
 <para>Habitat structure</para>
 <para>The structure of the riparian and the savanna habitat types were assessed along</para>
 <para>50m transects through the following characteristics; vegetation height (cm), soil</para>
 <para>penetration (pressure per cm^2), proximity to rock outcrop (m), woody debris, live trees,</para>
 <para>burrows, and rocks. Soil penetration measures, using a soil penetrometer, were used to</para>
 <para>relate habitat type soil compactness to the facilitation of fossorial species. Trap site</para>
 <para>proximity to rock outcroppings and number of live trees were used to impart suitable,</para>
 <para>stable herpetofauna microhabitat. Woody-debris, burrows and rocks were considered as</para>
 <para>microhabitats if they were of sufficient size for reptiles (lizards and small snakes) and</para>
 <para>amphibians to take refuge. Vegetation height was used to characterize the available</para>
 <para>cover present at each trap site. Transects were walked along a north-south orientation</para>
 <para>within each trapping area, soil penetration measures were taken every ten meters and the</para>
 <para>number of live trees, woody debris, burrows, rocks and vegetation height measures were</para>
 <para>taken every meter along each transect.</para>
 <para>Data analysis</para>
 <para>The data collected from the two sets of replicate plots were pooled to determine</para>
 <para>the herpetofaunal species richness (S), abundance (N) and diversity (H&#8217;) within each</para>
 <para>habitat type. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H&#8217;) was used in this case as it allows</para>
 <para>for the incorporation of the number of species as well as the number of individuals of</para>
 <para>each species in calculating community information. Herpetofaunal measures as well as</para>
 <para>121</para>
 <para>the measures of habitat structure were run through Primer (v5) to generate similarity</para>
 <para>matrices. The ordination outputs provided a graphic perspective characterizing the two</para>
 <para>habitat types based on the species assemblage similarity between the trap sites. Each of</para>
 <para>the three herpetofaunal groups in addition to the seven habitat structure measures were</para>
 <para>tested for normality and then compared individually, if normal, between different habitat</para>
 <para>types using a one-way ANOVA analysis in Statistica (6.0). The richness, abundance and</para>
 <para>diversity for the three herpetofaunal groups were then compared individually against the</para>
 <para>seven habitat characters in a regression analysis to determine whether any of the habitat</para>
 <para>structures measures explained herpetofaunal patterns. Finally the herpetofaunal species</para>
 <para>list for both habitat types were divided into guilds based on genus similarity and</para>
 <para>preference for micro-habitat. Amphibian species were grouped into three guilds and</para>
 <para>reptile species were grouped into four guilds and the abundances were compared in a</para>
 <para>multi-factorial ANOVA analysis, again in Statistica (6.0).</para>
