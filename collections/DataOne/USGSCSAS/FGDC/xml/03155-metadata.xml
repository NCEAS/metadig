    <descript>
      <abstract>The vegetation units on this map were determined through a series of image processing steps including unsupervised classification, ecological modeling and stereoscopic interpretation of aerial photographs supported by field sampling and ecological analysis. The vegetation boundaries were identified on the photographs by means of the photographic signature and collateral information on slope, hydrology, geography, and vegetation in accordance with the Standardized National Vegetation Classification System (October 1995). The mapped vegetation reflects conditions that existed during the specific year and season that the aerial photographs were taken. There is a margin of error inherent in the use of aerial photographs. Therefore, a detailed ground and historical analysis of a single site may result in a revision of the vegetation alliance boundaries established through photographic interpretation.</abstract>

      <supplinf>Established May 24, 1911, and on 20,453.932 acres, Colorado National Monument consists of geologic features including: towering red sandstone monoliths, deep sheer-walled canyons, and a variety of wildlife (bighorn sheep, golden eagles, mule deer, and mountain lions).</supplinf>

    <logic>All polygon features are checked for topology using the ArcGIS software.  Each polygon begins and ends at the same point with the node feature. All nodes are checked for error so that there are no dangling features. There are no duplicate lines or polygons. All nodes will snap together and close polygons based on a specified tolerance. If the node is not within the tolerance it is adjusted manually. The tests for logical consistency are performed in ArcGIS. All attribute codes and attributes have been checked
for typographical and logical errors.</logic>
    <complete>All data in the project area were classified and digitized. This includes alliances/community association classes, density classes, height classes, pattern groups, water, and unvegetated/landuse.</complete>

        <procdesc>Classification of the vegetation communities was performed by ecologists based on the field data that were collected.  Compiled data are assembled into a single file and transformed mathematically to a common abundance scale. The element classification process is implemented using quantitative approaches of ordination, clustering, and correlation depending on the information available. Multivariate analysis programs are used to examine the floristic patterns and their relationships to measured environmental variables.  Despite their utility in synthesizing large data sets, many of the analytical programs identify vegetation patterns that are statistically but not ecologically meaningful. The quantitative analysis to determine vegetation patterns must be carried out under the guidance and review of experts who have a practical understanding of the ecological relationships in the field.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>The National Vegetation Classification Standard is organized hierarchically to support conservation and resource stewardship applications across multiple scales. The upper levels of the hierarchy are based on the physical form or structure of the vegetation (physiognomy) and have been refined from the international standards developed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The two most detailed levels of the hierarchy are based on the species composition of existing vegetation (floristics) and reflect the phyto-sociological standards that were originally developed by European ecologists. The vegetation classification is continually advanced through the collection and analysis of new field data and will be greatly strengthened during the course of the USGS/NPS mapping efforts. Data file attributes include vegetation height, density, species, alliance, community element, and land cover. HEIGHT 1+AD0APA- 0.5 meters 2+AD0-0.5 - 2 meters 3+AD0-2 - 5 meters 4+AD0-5 - 15 meters 5+AD0-15 - 35 meters 6+AD0-35 - 50 meters 7+AD0APg- 50 meters 9+AD0-Not Applicable. DENSITY 1+AD0-Closed/Continuous +ADw- 60+ACU- 2+AD0-Discontinuous 40+ACU- - 60+ACU- 3+AD0-Dispersed 25+ACU- - 40+ACU- 4+AD0-Sparse 10+ACU- - 25+ACU- 5+AD0-Rare 2+ACU- - 10+ACU- 9+AD0-Not Applicable. Pattern 1,'Evenly Dispersed' 2,'Clumped/Bunched' 3,'Gradational/Transitional' 4,'Alternating' 9,'Not Applicable'. Field Name - Type  Description: OBJECTID - ObjectID - Sequential unique whole numbers, ESRI autogenerated. SHAPE - Geometry - Feature geometry, ESRI autogenerated. Polygon_ID - Text - Unique polygon identifier created for relationship purposes. Map_Unit_ID - Text - Code delineating the Map Unit for COLM. Map_Unit_Common_Name - Text - The common name of the map unit for COLM. Edit_Date - Date - The date the polygon was last edited. Edit_Notes - Text - Notes detailing any edits made to a polygon. SHAPE_Length - Double - Length of feature in internal units. SHAPE_Area - Double - Area of feature in internal units squared. Acres - Double - Acres calculated using X-tools. Hectares - Double - Hectares created using X-tools.</eaover>
