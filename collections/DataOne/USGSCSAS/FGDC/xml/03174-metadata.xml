      <abstract>The geographic information system (GIS) format spatial data set of vegetation for Grand Portage National Monument (GRPO) was created by the National Park Service (NPS) Vegetation Inventory Program (VIP). The GRPO covers an area of approximately 291.8 ha (721.1 acres). The map classification scheme used to create the vegetation data set is designed to represent local plant communities at the finest level possible using the National Vegetation Classification System. Physiognomic information was also recorded, including tree height, canopy density, and coverage patterns. The vegetation data set was developed by interpreting aerial photographs collected in 2006 and extensive field surveys. Individuals who cooperated in this project include; USGS Center for Biological Informatics, NPS Biological Resources Management Division, USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, NPS Grand Portage National Monument, and NatureServe. The vegetation data are distributed as an ESRI format file geodatabase, stored in Universal Transverse Mercator zone 16 mapping coordinates, North American Datum 1983.</abstract>
      <purpose>The NPS VIP is an effort to classify, describe, and map existing vegetation of national park units. Managed by the NPS Biological Resources Management Division, the NPS VIP provides baseline vegetation information for the NPS Natural Resource I&amp;M Program. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Vegetation Characterization Program lends a cooperative role in the NPS VIP. Vegetation layers and associated information support a wide variety of resource assessment, park management, and planning needs. They also provide structure for framing and answering critical scientific questions about vegetation communities and their relation to environmental processes across the landscape.

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The Grand Portage National Monument vegetation map has an overall attribute accuracy of 91.8% (Kappa index of 90.7%); calculated using information collected at 147 accuracy assessment sampling sites.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>All polygon features were checked for potential topology and attribute errors using the software program ArcGIS (version 9.2). Topology checks were performed to make sure each polygon was closed, no dangling features were present, each polygon contained a labeling point, and to make sure that no duplicate lines, polygons, or labels were present.</logic>
    <complete>All features identified by the photointerpreters were automated. Information stored in the map codes used by the photointerpreters (e.g., vegetation type, height, vegetation cover) are stored in the data set's attribute table and a series of lookup tables. The map codes are cross-referenced to the NVC (Vr2) at all physiognomic and floristic levels. The NPS VIP standard minimum mapping unit (MMU) of 0.25 ha (0.62 acres). A set of MMU templates were used to help photointerpreters determine minimum polygon size during the interpretive process. Because of angle distortions inherent to nonrectified aerial photos, and slight scale changes from high ridges to valley bottoms, the MMU was applied liberally.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The photointerpreted data were georeferenced and orthorectified using the software program Orthomapper, 3.75-minute USGS digital orthophoto quadrangles, and 1/3-degree national elevation data sets. The reference orthophotos have a horizontal root mean square error (RMSE) of no greater than 7.0 meters.  Field control for the orthophoto's reference images were acquired by third order class 1 or better survey methods, sufficiently spaced to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) for 1:12,000-scale products.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>No elevation information is stored in this data set.  Instead, elevation data was used during the orthorectification process minimize or eliminate distortions caused by changes in elevation.</vertaccr>

        <srccontr>In October 2006, GRPO was photographed using color infrared film at a scale of 1:12,000. The timing of these photographs was intended to capture peak leaf color change, so distinctions between various deciduous forest types would be easier to see.

            <othercit>A digital orthophoto is a digital image of an aerial photograph in which displacements caused by the camera and the terrain have been removed. It combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The standard digital orhthophoto produced by the USGS is a black-and-white, or color infrared, 1-meter ground resolution quarter quadrangle image. The accuracy and quality of USGS digital orthophotos must meet National Map Accuracy Standards at 1:12,000 scale for 3.75-minute quadrangles and at 1:24,000-scale for 7.5-minute quadrangles.</othercit>

        <srccitea>1:8,000 True Color Aerial Photos</srccitea>
        <srccontr>In May 2003, GRPO was photographed using true color film at a scale of 1:8,000. The timing of these photographs was intended to capture deciduous forest leaf-off conditions so that understory conditions could be viewed. These photographs were used as an ancillary photo set to determine understory characteristics during the photointerpretation process. They were used in support of photointerpreting the 12K Color IR Photos, which was the primary source of imagery for mapping.</srccontr>
      </srcinfo>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Introduction: Mapping vegetation of GRPO involved four primary steps; (1) field reconnaissance, (2) map classification, (3) photointerpretation, and (4) digital map automation and database development. Although these steps occurred sequentially, they overlap to some degree.</procdesc>
        <procdate>2007</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Field Reconnaissance: Before photointerpretation was initiated, photo interpreters made several visits to the GRPO to perform field reconnaissance. At this time, field trips were performed to a variety of locations within the APIS. Printed copies of the aerial photos that would be used during the photointerpretation process were brought along, so conditions on the ground could be compared to images contained in the photos. These trips helped the photointerpreters determine which plant types could be identified within the aerial photos.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Map Classification: The ultimate goal of the map classification was to represent the plant communities of GRPO as defined by the individuals who performed the vegetation classification project. The photointerpreters cooperated with the vegetation specialists to determine which vegetation types and communities could be accurately identified using the aerial photography. Some of the classes appearing in the final vegetation map might be comprised of a single vegetation type as identified by the vegetation classifiers, others may contain one of several different types. Not all vegetation types/communities visible on the ground are identifiable in an aerial photograph.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Photointerpretation: Photointerpretation was performed using Richards MIM light tables and Bausch &amp; Lomb Zoom 240 stereoscopes with variable zoom capabilities. Photointerpretation was performed on the 1:12,000-scale color infrared diapositives from 2006, using acetate overlays, Rapidograph ink pens (4x0-size, 0.18 mm) and Rapidraw black India ink (3084; waterproof, fast drying for film). Detailed information on how the photointerpretation processes were performed is available in the project's final report.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Orthorectification: Each aerial photograph was scanned at 400 dots per inch (dpi) and 64 million colors, producing a series of Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) images. The software program OrthoMapper was then used to register each image, establishing both horizontal and vertical coordinates. Existing orthophoto quadrangles (3.75-minute digital products) produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) were used to derive horizontal coordinates, 1/3 arc second digital elevation models (DEMs) were used to derive vertical measurements. Once orthophotos were created from the scanned photographs, each photointerpreted overlay was scanned at a resolution to 600dpi to create a 2-bit (black-and-white) TIFF image. The software OrthoMapper was then used to process each overlay, using the orthophoto created from overlay's corresponding aerial photograph to orthorectify the interpreted overlay. The individual orthorectified photos and overlays were then merged into workable groups for subsequent digitizing.</procdesc>

      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Conversion to GIS format files: The software program ArcGIS Desktop was then used to convert the orthorectified overlays into a GIS format data. The software program's ArcScan processing module was used to convert the raster images into vector data. A series of checks were performed to search for potential errors, then the photo interpreter's map classification codes were added to the vector data.</procdesc>

      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Creation of the Geodatabase: The attribute table of the initial GIS format vegetation map contained only the photo interpreter's map codes. To make these data more meaningful, a series of lookup tables were created which contained items such as the map class names, physiognomic information (plant heights, area of coverage, distribution patterns), and National Vegetation Classification System association and alliance codes. An ESRI format File Geodatabase was created to hold these data, as well as the vegetation point data collected for the map classification and attribute accuracy projects, the park boundary, and aerial photograph information. A series of relationship class files were added to the file geodatabase, to make it easier for users to associate the lookup tables with the GIS datasets.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20080501</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Accuracy Assessment: An in-depth accuracy project was performed on the geographic information system (GIS) format land cover data set. This was done to measure the probability of map accuracy (or, the absence of error). A series of computer selected random sampling sites were chosen for each map class in the data set. The mapping coordinates of these sites were then provided to field crews, who used global positioning system (GPS) receivers to locate each site. The land cover at each of these sites was compared to data developed by the photo interpreters, to determine the thematic accuracy of the data set. Detailed information on how this assessment was performed and its results are available in the project report.</procdesc>
