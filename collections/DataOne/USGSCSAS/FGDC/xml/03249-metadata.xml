      <abstract>National Park or National Monument boundary used to delineate project area. This is a vector polygon shapefile of 1992 Boundary Data for Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park. This data represents the boundary established by Congress authorizing the purchase of the land.</abstract>
      <purpose>To assist with the development of vegetation maps for the National Park Service.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Boundary data were downloaded by the Colorado Natural Heritage Program/Colorado State University on 12/04/2009 from https://irma.nps.gov/App/Reference/Search and imported to the file geodatabase.

On May 8, 1846 troops of the United States and Mexico clashed on the prairie of Palo Alto in the first battle of a two-year war. Signed into law in June 1992, Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park preserves the 3,400-acre scene of this clash between nations and informs visitors about its national and international importance. As the only unit of the National Park Service with a primary focus on the U.S.-Mexican War, Palo Alto Battlefield also interprets the entire conflict, including the details of its origins and the broad range of consequences. In an effort to turn a scene of conflict into a place of bi-national exchange and understanding, all research and interpretation conducted by the park reflects perspectives of both the United States and Mexico.</supplinf>
