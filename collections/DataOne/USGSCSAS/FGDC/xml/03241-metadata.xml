      <abstract>Accuracy Assessment, Observation and Plot Points. Currently there are NO plot points in this feature class, only accuracy assessment points.</abstract>
      <purpose>To assist with the development of vegetation maps for the National Park Service. Plots were collected to characterize actual vegetation, while accuracy assessment plots were visited to verify the mapper's interpretation of the vegetation communities.</purpose>
      <supplinf>No plots were developed for this project. Accuracy assessment points were acquired, but no attributes were assigned to the accuracy assessment points. Refer to whisaarpt.pdf for more detailed information.</supplinf>

      <attraccr>Our field crew sampled 499 usable thematic accuracy assessment plots during the summer and fall of 2004 that were distributed throughout the study area. The point estimate from the sample of 499 plots for the overall thematic accuracy is 61.5 percent for the 38 associations-alliances classes. The one-sided, 90 percent confidence interval is 2.9 percent, assuming a binomial distribution. It can be concluded that with 90 percent certainty the estimated accuracy of the map is equal to or greater than 58.6 percent (61.5 - 2.9). This poor accuracy resulted from confusion between similar associations and sometime between similar alliances.

The point estimate from the sample of 499 plots for the overall thematic accuracy is 79.8 percent for the alliance level of classification. The one-sided, 90 percent confidence interval is 2.4 percent, assuming a binomial distribution. It can be concluded that with 90 percent certainty the estimated overall accuracy of the map is equal to or greater than 77.4 percent (79.8 - 2.4). The point estimate from the sample of 499 plots for the overall thematic accuracy of the mapping units map is 85.6 percent. The one-sided, 90 percent confidence interval is 2.1 percent, assuming a binomial distribution. It can be concluded that with 90 percent certainty the estimated accuracy of the mapping units map is equal to or greater than 83.5 percent (85.6 - 2.1) exceeding the USGS-NPS standard of 80 percent for thematic accuracy.</attraccr>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Polygons that were less than 500 meters from a road were selected as the sampling population. Then polygons were selected from a random sample of those polygons until 15 polygons were selected from each class (strata). We used a progressive approach to selecting polygons, first selecting from polygons within 100 meters from any existing road and then when the required number of sampled polygons per strata was not met, expanding to 300 meters from a road and finally to 500 meters. The USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program (1994) standards allow for departure from a purely stratified random sample to allow for access problems. The nature of the landscape in the Whiskeytown Unit demanded that we constrain our sampling to those polygons near existing roads otherwise the field data collection would have taken several summer field seasons and been excessively expensive. For polygons actually intersected by a road, field crews avoided areas in which any direct effects of the road surface, or its cut slope or fill slope, occurred. The map was not fully completed at the time of sample polygon selection for field measurement and the beginning of field sampling. The field crews did not know the mapped vegetation class of the polygon they sampled and the accuracy assessment samples were analyzed after the map was completely finished.</procdesc>
