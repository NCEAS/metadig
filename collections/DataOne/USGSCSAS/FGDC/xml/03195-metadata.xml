      <abstract>The geographic information system (GIS) format spatial data set of vegetation for Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore (PIRO) was created by the National Park Service (NPS) Vegetation Inventory Program (VIP). The PIRO covers an area of approximately 36,046 ha (89,072 acres). The map classification scheme used to create the vegetation data set is designed to represent local vegetation types at the finest level possible using the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) Standard (Vr 2). Physiognomic information was also recorded, including height (woody vegetation), canopy density, and coverage patterns. The vegetation data set was developed by interpreting aerial photographs collected in 2005 and extensive field surveys. Individuals who cooperated in this project include; USGS Center for Biological Informatics, NPS Biological Resources Management Division, USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, NPS Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, and NatureServe. The vegetation data are distributed as an ESRI format file geodatabase, stored in Universal Transverse Mercator zone 16 mapping coordinates, North American Datum 1983.</abstract>
      <purpose>The NPS VIP is an effort to classify, describe, and map existing vegetation of national park units. Managed by the NPS Biological Resources Management Division, the NPS VIP provides baseline vegetation information for the NPS Natural Resource I&amp;M Program. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Vegetation Characterization Program lends a cooperative role in the NPS VIP. Vegetation layers and associated information support a wide variety of resource assessment, park management, and planning needs. They also provide structure for framing and answering critical scientific questions about vegetation communities and their relation to environmental processes across the landscape.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The PIRO vegetation map has an overall attribute accuracy of 77.1% (Kappa index of 76.0%); calculated using information collected at 837 accuracy assessment sampling sites.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>All polygon features were checked for potential topology and attribute errors using the software program ArcGIS (version 9.2). Topology checks were performed to make sure each polygon was closed, no dangling features were present, each polygon contained a labeling point, and to make sure that no duplicate lines, polygons, or labels were present.</logic>
    <complete>All features identified by the photointerpreters were automated. Information stored in the map codes used by the photointerpreters (e.g., vegetation type, height, vegetation cover) are stored in the data set's attribute table and a series of lookup tables. The map codes are cross-referenced to the NVC (Vr2) at all physiognomic and floristic levels. The NPS VIP standard minimum mapping unit (MMU) of 0.5 ha (1.24 acres) was applied for mapping. For types unique to its immediate surroundings (e.g., emergent wetland within an upland forest setting), mapping occurred below the standard MMU down to 0.25 ha (0.62 acres). In addition, two sparse vegetation map classes were set with an MMU of 0.25 ha (0.62 acres). Furthermore, a secondary MMU of 2.0 ha (4.94 acres) was applied for physiognomic feature changes within a particular map class (e.g., open vs. closed forest). A set of MMU templates were used to help photointerpreters determine minimum polygon size during the interpretive process. Because of angle distortions inherent to nonrectified aerial photos, and slight scale changes from high ridges to valley bottoms, the MMU was applied liberally.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The photointerpreted data were georeferenced and orthorectified using the software program Orthomapper, 3.75-minute USGS digital orthophoto quadrangles, and 1/3-degree national elevation data sets. The reference orthophotos have a horizontal root mean square error (RMSE) of no greater than 7.0 meters.  Field control for the orthophoto's reference images were acquired by third order class 1 or better survey methods, sufficiently spaced to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) for 1:12,000-scale products.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>No elevation information is stored in this data set.  Instead, elevation data was used during the orthorectification process minimize or eliminate distortions caused by changes in elevation.</vertaccr>

            <othercit>A digital orthophoto is a digital image of an aerial photograph in which displacements caused by the camera and the terrain have been removed. It combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The standard digital orhthophoto produced by the USGS is a black-and-white, or color infrared, 1-meter ground resolution quarter quadrangle image. The accuracy and quality of USGS digital orthophotos must meet National Map Accuracy Standards at 1:12,000 scale for 3.75-minute quadrangles and at 1:24,000-scale for 7.5-minute quadrangles.</othercit>

            <othercit>The National Elevation Dataset (NED) 1/3 Arc Second is a raster product assembled by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). NED 1/3 Arc Second is designed to provide National elevation data in a seamless form with a consistent datum, elevation unit, and projection. Data corrections are made in the NED 1/3 Arc Second assembly process to minimize, but not eliminate, artifacts, perform edge matching, and fill sliver areas of missing data. NED 1/3 Arc Second has a resolution of 1/3 arc-second (approximately 10 meters) for the conterminous United States.</othercit>

        <procdesc>Mapping vegetation of Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore (PIRO, also referred to as Lakeshore) and environs involved five primary steps: (1) preliminary map classification (2) field reconnaissance, (3) map classification, (4) photointerpretation, and (5) digital map automation and database development. Although these steps occurred sequentially, they overlap to some degree.ome degree.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20050109</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Field Reconnaissance:  Before photointerpretation was initiated, photointerpreters made several visits to the PIRO to perform field reconnaissance.  Field visits were performed to a variety of locations within the PIRO.  Printed copies of the aerial photos that would be used during the photointerpretation process were brought along so conditions on the ground could be compared to images contained in the photos.  These trips helped the photointerpreters further establish the map classification, determine what vegetation types could be identified within the aerial photos, and establish mapping convention on how best to apply the mapping of the vegetation types.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Map Classification:  The ultimate goal of the map classification was to represent the vegetation types of PIRO as determined by the vegetation classifiers (NatureServe).  The photointerpreters cooperated with the vegetation specialists to determine which vegetation types and communities could be accurately identified using the aerial photography.  Some of the classes appearing in the final vegetation map might be comprised of a single vegetation type as identified by the vegetation classifiers, others may contain one of several different types.  Not all vegetation types/communities visible on the ground are identifiable in an aerial photograph.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Photointerpretation:  Photointerpretation was performed using Richards MIM light tables and Bausch &amp; Lomb Zoom 240 stereoscopes with variable zoom capabilities.  Photointerpretation was performed on the October 2005 1:12,000-scale color infrared diapositives , using acetate overlays, Rapidograph ink pens (4x0-size, 0.18 mm) and Rapidraw black India ink (3084; waterproof, fast drying for film).  Features within the entire project extent were mapped.  Detailed information on how the photointerpretation processes were performed is available in the project's final report.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Orthorectification:  Each aerial photograph was scanned, producing a series of Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) images. The software program OrthoMapper was then used to register each image, establishing both horizontal and vertical coordinates. Existing orthophoto quadrangles (3.75-minute digital products) produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) were used to derive horizontal coordinates, and 1/3 arc second digital elevation models (DEMs) were used to derive vertical measurements.  Once orthophotos were created from the scanned photographs, each photointerpreted overlay was scanned to create a 2-bit (black-and-white) TIFF image.  The software OrthoMapper was then used to process each overlay, using the orthophoto created from overlay's corresponding aerial photograph to orthorectify the interpreted overlay.  The individual orthorectified photos and overlays were then merged into workable groups for subsequent digitizing.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Conversion to GIS format files:  The software program ArcGIS Desktop was then used to convert the orthorectified overlays into a GIS format data.  The software program's ArcScan processing module was used to convert the raster images into vector data.  A series of checks were performed to search for potential errors, then the photo interpreter's map classification codes were added to the vector data.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Creation of the Geodatabase: The attribute table of the initial GIS format vegetation map contained only the photointerpreter's map attribute codes.  To make these data more meaningful, a series of lookup tables were created which contained items such as the map class names, physiognomic information (woody plant heights, area of coverage, distribution patterns), and all NVC Vr2 hierarchy codes and nomenclature when known and applicable, including the finest floristic level of the hierarchy, association.  An ESRI format File Geodatabase was created to hold these data, as well as the vegetation point data that were collected for developing the vegetation classification and for the AA of the vegetation map, the project boundary extent, and aerial photograph information.  A series of relationship class files were added to the file geodatabase, to make it easier for users to associate the lookup tables with the GIS datasets.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20080501</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Accuracy Assessment:  An in-depth accuracy project was performed on the geographic information system (GIS) format vegetation polygon data set (vegetation map).  This was done to measure the probability of map accuracy (or, the absence of error).  A series of computer selected random sampling sites were chosen for each map class in the data set.  The mapping coordinates of these sites were then provided to field crews, who used global positioning system (GPS) receivers to locate each site.  The land cover at each of these sites was compared to data developed by the photo interpreters, to determine the thematic accuracy of the data set.  Detailed information on how this assessment was performed and its results are available in the project report.</procdesc>
