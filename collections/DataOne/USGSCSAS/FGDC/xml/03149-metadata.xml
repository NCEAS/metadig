<descript>
<abstract>The geographic information system (GIS) format spatial data set of vegetation for Saint Croix National Scenic Riverway (SACN) was created for the National Park Service (NPS) Vegetation Inventory Program (VIP). The SACN administrative boundary covers an area of nearly 39,500 ha. The project boundary for the SACN vegetation mapping project covers an areas of just over 68,200 ha with the approximate 300 m buffer. The map classification scheme used to create the vegetation data set is designed to represent local vegetation types at the finest level possible using the National Vegetation Classification Standard (NVCS) Version 2. Physiognomic information was also recorded, including height (woody vegetation), canopy density, and coverage patterns. The vegetation data set was developed by interpreting aerial photographs collected in October of 2005 and extensive field surveys. Individuals who cooperated in this project include; USGS Center for Biological Informatics, National Park Service (NPS) Biological Resources Management Division, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, NPS SACN, and NatureServe. The vegetation data are distributed as a polygon feature class in the geodatabase for the project, stored in Universal Transverse Mercator zone 15 mapping coordinates, North American Datum 1983.</abstract>
<purpose>The NPS VIP is an effort to classify, describe, and map existing vegetation of national park units. Managed by the NPS Biological Resources Management Division, the NPS VIP provides baseline vegetation information for the NPS Natural Resource I&amp;M Program. The USGS Vegetation Characterization Program lends a cooperative role in the NPS VIP and serves the data sets on the Internet. Vegetation layers and associated information support a wide variety of resource assessment, park management, and planning needs. They also provide structure for framing and answering critical scientific questions about vegetation communities and their relation to environmental processes across the landscape.</purpose>

<dataqual>
<attracc>
<attraccr>Based on a thematic AA study that was conducted of map classes representing floristic types in the NVCS, the vegetation map of the Saint Croix National Scenic Riverway has an overall attribute accuracy of 77.2% (Kappa index of 76.5%); calculated using field data collected at 1,257 accuracy assessment observation sites. Most individual map-class themes exceed the NPS VIP standard of 80% with a 90% confidence interval. The project report provides details pertaining to the methods of the accuracy assessment study and the results from the analysis.</attraccr>
</attracc>
<logic>All polygon features were checked for potential topology and attribute errors using the software program ArcGIS (9.3). Topology checks were performed to make sure each polygon was closed, no dangling features were present, each polygon contained a labeling point, and to make sure that no duplicate lines, polygons, or labels were present.</logic>
<complete>All features identified by the photointerpreters were georeferenced. Map-code information produced by the photointerpreters (e.g., vegetation type, vegetation cover) is stored in the attribute table of the data set and in a series of lookup tables. The map codes are cross-referenced to the NVCS (Vr2) at all physiognomic and floristic levels. The NPS VIP standard minimum mapping unit (MMU) of 0.5 ha (1.24 acres) was applied for mapping. For vegetation types unique to their immediate surroundings (e.g., an emergent wetland within an upland forest setting), a MMU down to 0.25 ha was applied. In addition, a secondary MMU of 2.0 ha was applied for physiognomic feature changes within a particular map class (e.g., open versus closed forest). A set of MMU templates were used to help photointerpreters determine minimum polygon size during the interpretative process. Because of angle distortions inherent to nonrectified aerial photos, and slight scale changes from high ridges to valley bottoms, the MMU was applied liberally.</complete>
<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>The photointerpreted data were georeferenced and orthorectified using the software program Orthomapper, 3.75-minute USGS digital orthophoto quadrangles, and 1/3-degree national elevation data sets. The reference orthophotos have a horizontal root mean square error (RMSE) of no greater than 7.0 meters. Field controls of the reference images for the orthophotos were acquired by third order class 1 or better survey methods, sufficiently spaced to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) for 1:12,000-scale products.</horizpar>
</horizpa>
<vertacc>
<vertaccr>No elevation information is stored in this data set. Instead, elevation data was used during the orthorectification process to minimize or eliminate distortions caused by changes in elevation.</vertaccr>

<srccitea>12K Color IR Photos</srccitea>
<srccontr>In October 2005, SACN was photographed using color infrared film at a scale of 1:12,000. The timing of these photographs was intended to capture peak leaf color change so distinctions between various deciduous forest types would be easier to see. These photographs were the primary source used during the photointerpretation process. Noteworthy, the lower portion of the Saint Croix River was in high-flood conditions during the October 2005 aerial photo collection. Within these flood locations, NAIP imagery dated summer 2006 was used to interpret wetland vegetation types.</srccontr>

<othercit>A digital orthophoto is a digital image of an aerial photograph in which displacements caused by the camera and the terrain have been removed. It combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. These images were used to orthorectify interpreted overlays of the same vintage photography.

<srccontr>This data set was used during the orthorectification process of the interpreted photo overlays. The digital orthophotos were used by the software program Orthomapper as an existing data set that has already been orthoreferenced (i.e., georeferenced, and elevation distortions have been removed). The photo overlays are aligned with the orthophotos, then the software program uses data stored in the orthophoto images along with available elevation data to georeference and remove elevation distortions from the photo overlays (i.e., orthorectify).</srccontr>

<othercit>The National Elevation Dataset (NED) 1/3 Arc Second is a raster product assembled by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). NED 1/3 Arc Second is designed to provide National elevation data in a seamless form with a consistent datum, elevation unit, and projection. Data corrections are made in the NED 1/3 Arc Second assembly process to minimize, but not eliminate, artifacts, perform edge matching, and fill sliver areas of missing data. NED 1/3 Arc Second has a resolution of 1/3 arc-second (approximately 10 meters) for the conterminous United States.</othercit>

Although these steps occurred sequentially, they overlap to some degree.</procdesc>

<procstep>
<procdesc>Preliminary Map Classification and Field Reconnaissance: Prior to field reconnaissance, mappers (UMESC) met with vegetation classifiers (NatureServe) to discuss the vegetation classification and how vegetation types might best be represented in a workable map classification. This built a working draft of the map classification to be used during field visits by the mappers. Before photointerpretation was initiated, photointerpreters made several visits to SACN to perform field reconnaissance. Field visits were performed to a variety of locations within the SACN. Printed copies of the aerial photos that would be used during the photointerpretation process were brought along so conditions on the ground could be compared to images contained in the photos. These trips helped the photointerpreters further establish the map classification, determine what vegetation types could be identified within the aerial photos, and establish mapping convention on how best to apply the mapping of the vegetation types. These field efforts were conducted during 2007 and 2008.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Map Classification: The ultimate goal of the map classification was to represent the vegetation types of SACN as determined by the vegetation classifiers (NatureServe). The photointerpreters cooperated with the vegetation specialists to determine which vegetation types and communities could be accurately identified using the aerial photographs. Some of the classes appearing in the final vegetation map might be comprised of a single vegetation type as identified by the vegetation classifiers, and others may contain one of several different types. Not all vegetation types visible on the ground are identifiable in an aerial photograph.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Photointerpretation: Photointerpretation was performed using Richards MIM light tables and Bausch &amp; Lomb Zoom 240 stereoscopes with variable zoom capabilities. Photointerpretation was performed on the October 2005 1:12,000-scale color-infrared diapositives, using acetate overlays, Rapidograph ink pens (4x0-size, 0.18 mm) and Rapidraw black India ink (3084; waterproof, fast drying for film). Features within the entire project extent were mapped. The April 2006 and 2007 true color aerial photographs were used as ancillary sources to help identify forest understory characteristics. Worth noting, the October 2005 color-infrared aerial photos captured flood waters throughout the lower portion of the Saint Croix River. Therefore, the mapping of flood-inundated herbaceous vegetation throughout the lower portions of the Saint Croix River (from Nevers Dam Landing south to Mississippi River) was interpreted onscreen in 2D using 2006 NAIP (true color) digital imagery. Because NAIP imagery is acquired at a one-meter ground sample distance, it did not provide enough resolution to map separately the individual vegetation types. We were, however, able to use the NAIP imagery to map the extents of herbaceous vegetation in general. A park-special map class was developed for this purpose.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Orthorectification: Each aerial photograph was scanned, producing a series of Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) images. The software program OrthoMapper was then used to register each image, establishing both horizontal and vertical coordinates. Existing orthophoto quadrangles (3.75-minute digital products) produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) were used to derive horizontal coordinates, and 1/3 arc second digital elevation models (DEMs) were used to derive vertical measurements. Once orthophotos were created from the scanned photographs, each photointerpreted overlay was scanned to create a 2-bit (black-and-white) TIFF image. The software OrthoMapper was then used to process each overlay, using the orthophoto created from overlay's corresponding aerial photograph to orthorectify the interpreted overlay. The individual orthorectified photos and overlays were then merged into workable groups for subsequent digitizing.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Conversion to GIS format files: The software program ArcGIS Desktop was then used to convert the orthorectified overlays into a GIS format data. The software program's ArcScan processing module was used to convert the raster images into vector data. A series of checks were performed to search for potential errors and then the map attribute codes from photointerpretation were added to the vector data.</procdesc>

<procstep>
<procdesc>Creation of the Geodatabase: The attribute table of the initial GIS format vegetation map contained only the map attribute codes that were assigned by the photointerpreters. To make these data more meaningful, a series of lookup tables were created, which contained items such as the map class names, physiognomic information (woody plant heights, area of coverage, distribution patterns), and all NVCS Vr2 hierarchy codes and nomenclature (when known and applicable), including the finest floristic level of the hierarchy, association. An ESRI format File Geodatabase was created to hold these data, as well as the vegetation plot data that were collected for developing the vegetation classification and for the accuracy assessment of the vegetation map, the project boundary extent, and aerial photograph information. A series of relationship class files were added to the file geodatabase, to make it easier for users to associate the lookup tables with the GIS datasets.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Accuracy Assessment: An in-depth accuracy project was performed on the geographic information system (GIS) format vegetation polygon data set (vegetation map). This was done to measure the probability of map accuracy (or, the absence of error). A series of computer selected random sampling sites were chosen for each map class in the data set. The mapping coordinates of these sites were then provided to field crews, who used global positioning system (GPS) receivers to locate each site. The field data and calls at each of these sites were compared to polygon data and calls made by the photointerpreters to determine the thematic accuracy of the vegetation map. Detailed information on how this assessment was performed and its results are available in the project report.</procdesc>
