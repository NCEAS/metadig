      <abstract>This feature class contains point features which represent locations of vegetation sampling plots in Gauley River National Recreation Area. Location coordinates for most plots were collected using a global positioning system and details on these data are included in the attribute table. The attribute table includes information on GPS methods and accuracy, date of plot sampling, surveyors names, and community classification. Complete data from plots is archived in the Plots2-WV database maintained by the West Virginia Natural Heritage Program. In this data set, the X, Y coordinates for 11 plots have been altered to protect species of concern. Also shows the location of thematic accuracy assessment sampling points used in the vegetation classification and mapping of Gauley River National Recreation Area. Also shows the location of thematic accuracy assessment sampling points used in the vegetation classification and mapping of Gauley River National Recreation Area.</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this data set is to provide locations of plots that were sampled in order to develop a classification of natural and semi-natural vegetation and to identify the locations of sampling points used to assess the thematic accuracy in Gauley River National Recreation Area.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Data were reformatted to match Plots V3.0 by the USGS/CSS/BIP/Center for Biological Informatics.</supplinf>

    <logic>Points were derived from Trimble GPS Coordinates or hand mapped on topographic maps. A few points fall outside the proclamation boundaries of Gauley River National Recreation Area.</logic>
    <complete>Includes all plots sampled for project. Also includes plots sampled by West Virginia Natural Heritage Program in 1995 from riparian areas in the park and in 2000 from Carnifax Ferry State Park. Each accuracy assessment point is represented by one point in the shapefile.  All points fall within the geographic extent of the vegetation map.</complete>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Plots were subjectively chosen to sample the geographic range and ecological diversity of the study area. Plot locations were selected along elevational gradients or to sample unique community types as they were encountered in the field. An ecological land unit model was developed to improve sampling equity across landform, elevation, aspect, and geological gradients. Throughout the project, plots were located to represent high quality natural vegetation (relatively weed free, away from roads and other human caused ground disturbance, etc) for natural types, but semi-natural types (e.g. successional forests, old fields) were also sampled. Point features were produced from locational coordinates collected using GPS units (Trimble GeoExplorer, GeoXT; Garmin) or from points mapped by hand on topographic maps. GPS data from Trimble units were post-process differentially corrected and exported as attributed GIS files using Trimble Pathfinder Office software. Plot points were attributed with community names determined by the vegetation classification.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The number and distribution of sampling points was determined by map class abundance and frequency as recommended in the USGS/NPS Vegetation Mapping protocols.  A stratified random sampling approach was used, distributing the sampling effort across the vegetation map classes.  A random sample of points stratified by vegetation map class was selected.  Random points were generated in ArcGIS.  Sample points located close to polygon boundaries were moved to at least 30 meters inside the polygon to avoid ecotones.  In long narrow polygons where that was not possible, sample points were moved to a point approximately equidistant from the polygon boundaries.  An ArcGIS shapefile containing the sample points was created and the attribute table was edited to include the fields needed to record the data to be collected at each point.  The shapefile was imported into Trimble .ssf format and loaded into a Trimble GeoXT global positioning system (GPS) unit.  This allowed the field ecologist to enter data directly into an electronic file in real time.  In September 2009, an ecologist collected field data at a total of 147 sample points.  Accuracy assessment points were located in the field using a Trimble GeoXT GPS unit.  The vegetation or land cover at each accuracy assessment point was classified based on the vegetation key developed for the vegetation mapping project.</procdesc>
