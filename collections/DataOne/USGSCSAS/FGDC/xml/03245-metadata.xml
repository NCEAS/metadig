      <abstract>Devils Tower National Monument boundary. Derived from a dataset containing 342 National Park System unit boundaries.  Under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service (NPS), these park units are located throughout the United States (U.S.) and its territories.  Almost all the parks are located north of the equator in the western hemisphere; although a couple parks are south of the equator or in the eastern hemisphere.  The dataset was compiled (and edited) from a variety sources: park-based GIS databases; U.S. Geological Survey 7.5' 1:24,000 quadrangles; NPS Park Land Status Maps; legal descriptions; etc.).  The boundaries are in Latitude-Longitude (Clarke 1866-NAD27) decimal degrees.  The ID_ field contains the unique 4 character park code identifying each park.  The NAME1_ field contains the full park name.  The NAME2_ field contains information about the source, scale, and date of the boundary.  The boundaries are generally the designated boundary.  Inholdings may or may not be shown depending on the park. This dataset was originally created in Environmental System's Research Institute's (ESRI) ATLAS*GIS software and is currently maintained in this software.  This version of the dataset was created using ESRI's ArcTools 8.0.2 Import to ShapeFile from .AGF file command, ShapeFile to Coverage command, and then Export to Interchange File.  To obtain the most accurate, current boundary, users should contact the specific park.</abstract>
      <purpose>These digital park unit boundary should not be used for any legal boundary disputes.  It is intended solely for use only in identifying the general location of Devils Tower National Monument.  This dataset was compiled to assist the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program in determining the proximity of vegetation features to Devils Tower National Monument.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The Shapefile was imported into a geodatabase by the National Park Service.</supplinf>
