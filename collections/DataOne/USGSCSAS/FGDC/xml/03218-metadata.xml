      <abstract>The geographic information system (GIS) format spatial data set of vegetation for Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (INDU) was created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)-National Park Service (NPS) Vegetation Mapping Program (VMP). The INDU covers an area of approximately 37,050 ha (15,000 acres), and includes approximately 15 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline.  Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore is divided into seven units (East Unit, West Unit, Calumet Prairie, Heron Rookery, Hobart Prairie Grove, Hoosier Prairie, and Pinhook Bog).  The map classification scheme used to create the vegetation data set is designed to represent local plant communities at the finest level possible using the National Vegetation Classification System. Physiognomic information was also recorded, including tree height, canopy density, and coverage patterns. The vegetation data set was developed by interpreting aerial photographs collected in 2004 and extensive field surveys. Individuals who cooperated in this project include; USGS Center for Biological Informatics, NPS Biological Resources Management Division, USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, NPS Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, and NatureServe. The vegetation data are distributed as an ESRI format file geodatabase, stored in Universal Transverse Mercator zone 16 mapping coordinates, North American Datum 1983.</abstract>
      <purpose>The USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program (VMP) is a cooperative effort by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Park Service (NPS) to classify, describe, and map existing vegetation of national park units for the Natural Resource Inventory and Monitoring Program. The goals of this project are to (1) adequately describe and map plant communities of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and (2) provide the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Program, resource managers, and biological researchers with useful baseline vegetation information.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (INDU) covers approximately 15,000-acres of land on the southern end of Lake Michigan, in a highly developed and industrialized region of the United States.  The park extends from Gary, IN (population 103,000) located on the eastern side of the Chicago metropolitan area (population 9 million) to Michigan City, IN (population 33,000).  The INDU was authorized and given protection as a National Lakeshore in 1966, after a 67-year movement to save the area from development.  The INDU contains more than 1,135 native plant species and ranks seventh in plant diversity amongst all national parks in the United States.  The creation of a vegetation map for INDU was conducted as a part of a larger effort to map the Great Lakes Network of National Parks, Lakeshores, and Monuments (Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, Grand Portage National Monument, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, Saint Croix National Scenic Riverway, Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Isle Royale National Park, and Voyageurs National Park).  A detailed report on how the INDU vegetation map was created is available.

The initial product delivery for the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Vegetation Mapping Project was in October 2008.  An update to select products was completed in September 2009. Since the initial delivery of products, the program name has undergone a name change.  For purposes of this metadata, most references to the "USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program" are now the "NPS Vegetation Inventory Program."  Occasionally, references to point of contacts are now the "USGS Vegetation Characterization Program."</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore vegetation map has an overall attribute accuracy of 78.2% (Kappa index of 76.9%); calculated using information collected at 484 accuracy assessment sampling sites.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>All polygon features were checked for potential topology and attribute errors using the software program ArcGIS (version 9.2). Topology checks were performed to make sure each polygon was closed, no dangling features were present, each polygon contained a labeling point, and to make sure that no duplicate lines, polygons, or labels were present.</logic>
    <complete>All features identified by the photointerpreters were automated. Information stored in the map codes used by the photointerpreters (e.g., vegetation community, tree height, vegetation cover) are stored in the data set's attribute table and a series of lookup tables. The map codes are cross-referenced to the National Vegetation Classification System, at all physiognomic and floristic levels. A standard minimum mapping unit (MMU) of 0.5 ha (1.24 acres) was used, with the exceptions of certain wetlands in the West Unit where a MMU of 0.1 ha (0.25 acres) was used.  A secondary MMU of 2.0 ha (4.96 acres) was used for physiognomic feature changes within a particular map class. A set of MMU templates were developed to help the photo interpreters determine minimum polygon size during the interpretation process. Because of angle distortions inherent to nonrectified aerial photos and slight scale changes from high ridges to valley bottoms, the MMU was applied liberally. Also, vegetation types unique to their surroundings (e.g., emergent wetland within an upland forest setting) were often mapped down to 0.25 ha (0.62 acres).</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The photointerpreted data were georeferenced and orthorectified using the software program Orthomapper, 3.75-minute USGS digital orthophoto quadrangles, and 1/3-degree national elevation data sets. The reference orthophotos have a horizontal root mean square error (RMSE) of no greater than 7.0 meters.  Field control for the orthophoto's reference images were acquired by third order class 1 or better survey methods, sufficiently spaced to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) for 1:12,000-scale products.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>No elevation information is stored in this data set.  Instead, elevation data was used during the orthorectification process minimize or eliminate distortions caused by changes in elevation.</vertaccr>

            <othercit>A digital orthophoto is a digital image of an aerial photograph in which displacements caused by the camera and the terrain have been removed. It combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The standard digital orhthophoto produced by the USGS is a black-and-white, or color infrared, 1-meter ground resolution quarter quadrangle image. The accuracy and quality of USGS digital orthophotos must meet National Map Accuracy Standards at 1:12,000 scale for 3.75-minute quadrangles and at 1:24,000-scale for 7.5-minute quadrangles.</othercit>

        <procdesc>Introduction:  Mapping vegetation of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (INDU) and environs involved four primary steps; (1) field reconnaissance, (2) map classification, (3) photointerpretation, and (4) digital map automation and database development. Although these steps occurred sequentially, they overlap to some degree.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20040101</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Field Reconnaissance:  Before photointerpretation was initiated, photo interpreters made several visits to the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (INDU) to perform field reconnaissance.  At this time, field trips were performed to a variety of locations within the INDU.  Printed copies of the aerial photos that would be used during the photointerpretation process were brought along, so conditions on the ground could be compared to images contained in the photos.  These trips helped the photointerpreters determine which plant types could be identified within the aerial photos.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Map Classification:  The ultimate goal of the map classification was to represent the plant communities of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore as defined by the individuals who performed the vegetation classification project.  The photointerpreters cooperated with the vegetation specialists to determine which vegetation types and communities could be accurately identified using the aerial photography.  Some of the classes appearing in the final vegetation map might be comprised of a single vegetation type as identified by the vegetation classifiers, others may contain one of several different types.  Not all vegetation types/communities visible on the ground are identifiable in an aerial photograph.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Photointerpretation:  Photointerpretation was performed using Richards MIM light tables and Bausch &amp; Lomb Zoom 240 stereoscopes with variable zoom capabilities.  Photointerpretation was performed on the 1:12,000-scale color infrared diapositives from 2004, using acetate overlays, Rapidograph ink pens (4x0-size, 0.18 mm) and Rapidraw black India ink (3084; waterproof, fast drying for film).  During this process, Spring 2005 true-color aerial photography at a scale of 1:12,000 and Fall 2004 color-infrared aerial photography at a scale of 1:6,000 was used as a reference source to assist with the identification of various land cover types.  Detailed information on how the photointerpretation processes were performed is available in the project's final report.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Orthorectification:  Each aerial photograph was scanned at 400 dots per inch (dpi) and 64 million colors, producing a series of Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) images. The software program OrthoMapper was then used to register each image, establishing both horizontal and vertical coordinates. Existing orthophoto quadrangles (3.75-minute digital products) produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) were used to derive horizontal coordinates, 1/3 arc second digital elevation models (DEMs) were used to derive vertical measurements.  Once orthophotos were created from the scanned photographs, each photointerpreted overlay was scanned at a resolution to 600dpi to create a 2-bit (black-and-white) TIFF image.  The software OrthoMapper was then used to process each overlay, using the orthophoto created from overlay's corresponding aerial photograph to orthorectify the interpreted overlay.  The individual orthorectified photos and overlays were then merged into workable groups for subsequent digitizing.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Conversion to GIS format files:  The software program ArcGIS Desktop was then used to convert the orthorectified overlays into a GIS format data.  The software program's ArcScan processing module was used to convert the raster images into vector data.  A series of checks were performed to search for potential errors, then the photo interpreter's map classification codes were added to the vector data.</procdesc>

      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Creation of the Geodatabase: The attribute table of the initial GIS format vegetation map contained only the photo interpreter's map codes.  To make these data more meaningful, a series of lookup tables were created which contained items such as the map class names, physiognomic information (plant heights, area of coverage, distribution patterns), and National Vegetation Classification System association and alliance codes.  An ESRI format File Geodatabase was created to hold these data, as well as the vegetation point data collected for the map classification and attribute accuracy projects, the park boundary, and aerial photograph information.  A series of relationship class files were added to the file geodatabase, to make it easier for users to associate the lookup tables with the GIS datasets.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20080501</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Accuracy Assessment:  An in-depth accuracy project was performed on the geographic information system (GIS) format land cover data set.  This was done to measure the probability of map accuracy (or, the absence of error).  A series of computer selected random sampling sites were chosen for each map class in the data set.  The mapping coordinates of these sites were then provided to field crews, who used global positioning system (GPS) receivers to locate each site.  The land cover at each of these sites was compared to data developed by the photo interpreters, to determine the thematic accuracy of the data set.  Detailed information on how this assessment was performed and its results are available in the project report.  The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore vegetation map has an overall attribute accuracy of 78.2% (Kappa index of 76.9%); calculated using information collected at 484 accuracy assessment sampling sites.</procdesc>

        <enttypl>tbl_vegmap_alliance</enttypl>
        <enttypd>This lookup table contains information on the floristic alliance associated with each map class.  Alliances are physiognomically uniform group of plant associations sharing one or more dominant or diagnostic species, which as a rule are found in the uppermost stratum of the vegetation.  The names of dominant and diagnostic species are the foundation of the alliance names.  At least one species from the dominant and/or uppermost stratum is included.  In rare cases where the combination of species in the upper and lower strata is strongly diagnostic, species from other strata are included in the name.  Species occurring in the same stratum are separated by a hyphen ( - ), and those occurring in a different strata are separated by a slash ( / ).  Species occurring in the uppermost stratum are listed first, followed successively by those in lower strata. The lowest possible number of species is used for an alliance name, with a maximum of four species allowed.  When the vegetation polygon data are brought into an ArcGIS map, these data will be automatically linked to the vegetation polygons.  The information is accessible through the Identify function.  When Identify is used, you will need to (1) expand the data tree located on the left-hand side of the Identify window, (2) locate the lookup table tbl_vegmap_alliance, and (3) click on the entry located underneath.  If you would like to (a) see these data in the attribute table of the vegetation polygon dataset (b) be able to perform attribute queries against the lookup table's data, or (c) be able to symbolize (shade or label) the vegetation polygons using the lookup table's data, you will need to use the "Add Join" geoprocessing tool.

When Identify is used, you will need to (1) expand the data tree located on the left-hand side of the Identify window, (2) locate the lookup table tbl_vegmap_association, and (3) click on the entry located underneath.  If you would like to (a) see these data in the attribute table of the vegetation polygon dataset (b) be able to perform attribute queries against the lookup table's data, or (c) be able to symbolize (shade or label) the vegetation polygons using the lookup table's data, you will need to use the "Add Join" geoprocessing tool.  "Add Join" is located under Data Management Tools ---&gt; Joins.  The Map_Class_ID field is Input and Output Join field.  Map_Class_ID exists in both tables, lookup and attribute.</enttypd>
