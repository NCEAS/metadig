      <abstract>A vegetation map of Thomas Stone National Historic Site based on field surveys conducted in 2001, interpretation of aerial photography acquired in 2002, and accuracy assessment field surveys completed in 2003 and 2004.  This vegetation dataset includes twelve associations (seven semi-natural types and four types of recent anthropogenic origin), as well as two modified Anderson level II categories.</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this study is to classify and describe vegetation at Thomas Stone National Historic Site within the framework of the U.S. National Vegetation Classification System (USNVCS). The vegetation map is one of the minimal data sets of an essential resource inventory for managing more than 250 units of the National Park System with significant natural resources.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The Shapefile was imported to a file geodatabase by the USGS/CSS/Core Science Analytics and Synthesis.</supplinf>

      <attraccr>Overall accuracy for the vegetation map (all accuracy assessment points pooled) was 82.8%, with a 90% confidence interval of 71.0 to 94.7%, and a Kappa statistic accuracy of 79.7%. If the user's accuracy rates for each class are weighted by the class areas in the map (excluding the two classes for which accuracy assessment data were not collected), then the overall map accuracy weighted by class area is 82.2%.</attraccr>
      <qattracc>

        <attracce>Thematic accuracy assessment that was conducted on the vegetation association map largely followed the protocols of the USGS/NPS Vegetation Mapping Program.  (For complete details, see the technical report cross-referenced at the end of the Identifcation Information section above.)

A dichotomous key to the associations was developed, and, with the local descriptions of associations, was provided to researchers conducting the accuracy assessment. Accuracy assessment was conducted during the week of October 6-10, 2003, when most of the points were visited. On November 7, 2003, points in cultural (managed) vegetation, the map class representing storm residue (blowdowns from the 2002 tornado), and remaining natural accuracy assessment points were sampled. Following analysis of the results, it was determined that several situations contributed to high error rates between some similar classes. The observers had not had adequate practice with the key or the concepts in the descriptions, nor had the key itself been tested on observers in representative vegetation in order to correct key errors. As a result, it was decided to treat the initial accuracy assessment effort as a map validation to improve the classification, the map, and the key. Modifications were made to the classification scheme, the descriptions, and key for most of the map classes/associations representing natural vegetation. Because these modifications were made from information gained by the validation, a subsequent, independent accuracy assessment was conducted in June 2004 for each map class/association that was modified. Accuracy assessment data collected in 2003 for classes/associations not modified were retained.</attracce>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>A preliminary vegetation dataset for Thomas Stone National Historic Site was created by interpreting digital orthophotomosaics to delineate polygons at a more general level than that of the association, related in part to the formation level defined in the U.S. National Vegetation Classification System. In accordance with USGS/NPS VMP protocols (USGS 1994), the Level II land use and land cover classification system developed by Anderson, et al. (1976) was used to attribute heavily modified vegetation or non-vegetated polygons. To create the "formation-level" vegetation data set, a photointerpreter, viewing leaf-off and leaf-on photomosaics in two dimensions, delineated visible areas of homogeneous vegetation, land cover, and land use using onscreen digitizing tools of ArcView version 9.1.  The minimum mapping unit was 0.5 hectares (1.25 acres); however, the photointerpreter was able to delineate polygons as small as 0.2 hectares (0.5 acres).  After polygons were delineated for the entire park area, the photointerpreter created and populated three fields in the attribute table, entering a unique polygon identification number, the formation-level vegetation class or other land use/land cover code, and notes if the interpreter was unsure of the appropriate code or could not assign a code. Next, the photointerpreter examined each formation-level vegetation polygon in three dimensions using ERDAS Imagine's Stereo Analyst software version 8.6, checked the vegetation class code entered in the attribute table, and entered a corrected formation or land use code if appropriate.

Following the vegetation data analysis, the formation-level vegetation map was further edited and refined to develop an association-level vegetation map. All classified plot and observation point locations for Thomas Stone National Historic Site were transferred to a project base map, where they facilitated interpretation of photomosaic images and/or aerial photographs during the mapping phase of this project. Observation points were retrospectively assigned by subjective assignment to the USNVC associations identified during data analysis, or to the additional two small-patch USNVC associations newly classified in this study. For the most part, polygon boundaries were unchanged, but where distinctions noted in the field were not evident on either set of aerial photography, revisions to existing polygons were made based on GPS readings of the observation points. Each polygon containing a plot or observation point was attributed with the name of an association based on classification results. The remaining polygons were assigned to associations based on the previously assigned formation (land use polygons were not altered), as well as soil map, topographic map, and finer signature distinctions detected on the aerial photography, such as crown shape.</procdesc>
