      <abstract>This data set is a vector coverage depicting areas of the Oak Ridge Reservation where timber has been salvaged due to southern pine beetle infestations.  Bark beetles and particularly the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimm) have been a  known problem on the Oak Ridge Reservation in 1964, 1973, and 1993, and again in 1999.  The 1964 epidemic lasted until 1966 and killed over 200,000 trees.  Approximately 3,000 acres of pine forest were destroyed in the 1973-1976 outbreak and another 3,200 acres of pine forest in the 1993-1994 epidemic.  This map shows more recent outbreaks as observed during 1999 aerial surveys in the winter and early summer.  The September 1999 survey depicted by this map, revealed a visible loss of 811 acres of pine or 42,000 trees.  
     Actions recommended by the Forest Management Group after follow-up ground surveys confirmed the results of the September 1999 flyover follow include removal of dead and dying trees as quickly as possible according to priority.  All infested stands will be surveyed for wetlands or endangered species prior to timber salvage.  The coverage depicts three classes of timber areas designated to be salvaged.  The categories are ranked according to priority (1 being the highest, 3 being the lowest).

  Priority 1 - Infested stands that will experience increased fire hazards as trees continue to die   increasing fuel loads. Adverse impacts to Oak Ridge Reservation infrastructure (buildings,   fences, roads, wells, utilities, cemeteries, etc.) are imminent from continuously falling trees.    Diminished aesthetic qualities along public roadways and neighborhoods due to numerous dying   trees.  There is a high potential for continued southern pine bark beetle expansion within these    stands.  The potential for economic return from timber salvage is good.

  Priority 2 - Infested stands, which are somewhat more remote than Priority 1, but near Oak Ridge   Reservation roads.  While still exhibiting increased fuel loads, the direct impact of to Oak Ridge   Reservation infrastructures and aesthetics is lower.  A good economic return remains possible,   particularly when these stands are treated concurrently with nearby Priority 1 or other Priority 2   stands.

  Priority 3 - These stands are remote, isolated, and tend to have generally smaller infestations.    Fire hazards and aesthetic impacts are minimal.  Access is poor to nonexistent, constraining a   chance for economic return.  These category also includes stands for which requests for   non-action have been placed because of on-going field research.  Facility managers for these   areas retain responsibility for any future cleanup activities.  

     Forest regeneration plans will be developed for all impacted stands.  Plan options include a default favoring natural regeneration unless more specific management objectives dictate a planting scheme.  Natural regeneration is probably the most cost-effective method to restore native plant communities.  Intervention will likely be needed to assure non-native species do not significantly out-compete the desired native growth.
