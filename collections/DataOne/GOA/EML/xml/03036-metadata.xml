<abstract><para>From the original 1998 abstract for the project:
The Restoration Plan identifies four services as lost or reduced by the oil spill -- subsistence, commercial fishing, recreation/tourism, and passive use. In preparation for the 10 Years After symposium, the recovery status of each of these services will be updated. Most of the work will take place in FY 99. However, providing startup costs for the subsistence component in FY 98 will allow a planning workshop to be held, the survey instrument to be finalized, and community approvals for the survey to be obtained this summer. This schedule will allow the survey itself to begin in October 1998. A final report will be prepared in February 1999; results will also be presented at the 10 Years After symposium in March 1999. [NOTE: This project was approved by the Trustee Council June 8, 1998. In the court request, these funds are shown as an addition to 98052A rather than as the separate project 98471].

From the Restoration Project Final Report produced in 2004:
The project updated information about subsistence harvests in 15 communities in order to evaluate the status of this injured natural resource service. In total, 544 households were interviewed. Subsistence harvests in 2003 averaged about 350 pounds per person and included a diverse range of species. Most households used, harvested, and shared wild foods. While overall community harvests approximated pre-spill estimates, about half the households reported lower total subsistence uses than before the spill and 39 percent blamed spill effects for continuing lower uses of at least one resource. Many respondents reported increased effort to harvest resources due to scarcities and competition. Confidence in eating clams is very low or eroding in eight study communities due to concerns about paralytic shellfish poisoning and spill effects. There were ambiguous findings regarding the role of elders and whether youth are learning subsistence skills. Respondents were often uncertain about the link between changes in their communities and the oil spill. Overall, 72 percent of respondents said that the traditional way of life has not recovered from the spill. The spill is an example of a technological disaster that is prolonged, difficult to interpret, and changes both the natural and social environments.

Notes from David Koster in June 2013:
While the raw data is protected as confidential under AS16.05.815, publicly available data on subsistence use can be found on the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Community Subsistence Information System (CSIS) at http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/sb/CSIS/. Specific data requests from the EVOSTC-funded project can be placed with David Koster on a case-by-case basis. Data agreements would require that the data be reported  only in aggregate format, the division have the opportunity to participate, and the data must be returned to the division upon completion of the specific research project covered under the agreement. Some aggregated data could also be gleaned from the final report.</para>

<methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Ethical Principles</title>
<para>Four basic ethical principles guided the research. These were: 1) review and approval of the research plans by community governments prior to fieldwork; 2) informed consent by household members selected for interviewing (participation in the research was voluntary); 3) individual and household-level responses were held confidential; and 4) study results were reviewed by and shared with the study communities. These principles are consistent with the protocols adopted by the Trustee Council for the collection of traditional knowledge (TEK) and with research guidelines adopted by the Alaska Federation of Natives ((EVOS TC 1996; Miraglia 1998: Appendix A). BBNA has adopted a similar set of guidelines that were followed in this study (BBNA n.d.).</para>

<methodStep><description><section><title>Study Planning Workshop</title>
<para>A project planning workshop took place in Anchorage on February 3 and 4, 2004. Thirty people participated. A list of participants appears in Table I-2. Appendix A is the workshop agenda. In attendance were representatives of 13 of the 15 study communities (poor weather prevented designated representatives of Port Graham and Perryville from traveling to Anchorage); staff from BBNA, CRRC, and KANA; and ADF&amp;G staff. EVOS Trustee Council executive director Gail Phillips addressed the group at the start of the first day. As planned, workshop participants reviewed past study findings and current issues, and then identified questions and topics for the survey instrument. The survey instrument and training manual were completed over the next several days. At the same time, the project partners, working with tribal councils, identified residents of the study communities to be trained as local researchers to assist ADF&amp;G staff in conducting household interviews. The three partner organizations also focused on obtaining the remaining community approvals. In all but Cordova, the largest community, the goal was to interview a knowledgeable representative of every resident household. The sampling design in Cordova was a stratified random sample goal of 150 households (Table I-1). One hundred households were to be surveyed from the general population (excluding the Eyak Tribal Council's list) and 50 households were to be surveyed at random from the list of Alaska Native households maintained by the Eyak Tribal Council, for a total goal of 150 completed interviews.</para>

<methodStep><description><section><title>Survey Instrument</title>
<para>The survey instrument was modeled after those administered by the Division of Subsistence during previous rounds of research in the study communities. A sample survey instrument appears in Appendix B. Key sections on demography, resource harvests and uses, and evaluation of current subsistence uses and resource status were not modified significantly in order to maintain comparability with previous research. Based on the recommendations of participants in the project planning workshop, almost all of the evaluative questions from the 1998 survey instrument were retained. Two questions were added to gauge knowledge about the GEM program. Tribal participants at the study planning workshop emphasized the need for questions that allowed open-ended responses. The survey instrument was not designed for self-administration. Rather, a researcher (either a Division of Subsistence staff person (Subsistence Resource Specialist [SRS]) or a local researcher) administered the survey in face-to-face interviews in the study communities.</para>

<methodStep><description><section><title>Fieldwork and Sample Achievement</title>
<para>Fieldwork commenced soon after the planning workshop and was essentially complete by the end of May. Table I-3 provides a list of the local research assistants who conducted surveys in their communities after receiving training from ADF&amp;G staff. A detailed training manual, developed during previous rounds of surveys in these communities, guided the training. In every community except Cordova, the researchers developed a list of all community households. The SRS then conducted several interviews with the local researcher present to demonstrate the procedures. Next, the local researchers conducted a few interviews on their own. These completed forms were thoroughly reviewed by the SRS, who then reviewed any corrections with the local researcher. Then, the remaining interviews were completed, primarily by the local researchers.</para>
<para>In Cordova, a Division of Subsistence SRS traveled to consult with city officials prior to the fieldwork to update maps of the community. A random sample was drawn from lists of dwellings keyed to these maps. Additionally, a sample of households from the roles of the Eyak Tribe was drawn. Because of the large number of interviews to be conducted in Cordova, two SRSs, two seasonal ADF&amp;G employees who live in Cordova, and three local researchers hired by CRRC worked as a team until the interview goal was reached. In Cordova, the sampling goal included 50 interviews of randomly selected Eyak Tribe households and 100 randomly selected other households. Although sampling goals were initially met for the Eyak Tribe (56 households), a total of 84 other households were interviewed, 16 short of the goal. The Eyak Tribe volunteered to interview up to 16 other households in Cordova to meet the original goal of 100 for this stratum. This work took place in late June and early July, and was conducted at no additional expense to the project. Eight more households were surveyed, for a total of 92 for the other household stratum and 148 for Cordova in total.</para>
<para>Table I-4 provides an overview of sample achievement for each study community. In total, 544 household interviews were completed in the 15 study communities. This is an achievement of 77.2 percent of the sampling goal. Of all contacted households, 13.2 percent declined to participate in the survey. This is a modest refusal rate and consistent with other rounds of interviews in these communities. The rest of the households could not be contacted.</para>

<methodStep><description><section><title>Length of Survey Administration</title>
<para>As shown in Table I-5, on average, the surveys took 1.15 hours (69 minutes) to administer. For the survey administered in 1998, the average length of the interviews was 1.12 hours (67 minutes) (Fall and Utermohle 1999:16-17). This is longer than most surveys administered by the Division of Subsistence due to the inclusion of evaluation questions and questions with open-ended responses, as strongly recommended by study community representatives. The length of the survey may have discouraged some respondents and some local research assistants from fully responding to some of the evaluative questions.</para>

</methodStep>
<methodStep><description><section><title>Data Coding, Data Entry, Data Analysis, and Statistical Methods</title>
<para>All data were coded for data entry by Division of Subsistence staff in Anchorage and Dillingham. Responses were coded following standardized codebook conventions used by Division of Subsistence to facilitate data entry. A data collection supervisor reviewed coded forms prior to data entry. Staff within the Information Management Section set up database structures within an MS SQL Server at ADF&amp;G in Anchorage to hold the survey data. The database structures included rules, constraints, and referential integrity to insure that data were entered completely and accurately. Data entry screens were available on a secure internet site. Daily incremental backups of the database occurred, and transaction logs were backed up hourly. Full backups of the database occurred twice weekly. This ensured that no more than one hour of data entry would be lost in the unlikely event of a catastrophic failure.</para>
<para>In addition to conducting surveys, local research assistants were hired by the project partners to perform data entry. The first training session for local research assistants in data entry methods took place at ADF&amp;G in Anchorage on May 13. In total, six people attended this session. A second training occurred in Anchorage on June 15, attended by two people. Also, four individuals were trained by other trainees. All together, trainees (including partner staff) included three from BBNA, seven from CRRC, and two from KANA (for a total of twelve). Table I-6 provides a list of the eight individuals from study communities and project partners who conducted data entry. (Four others were trained but did not enter any surveys.) ADF&amp;G data entry personnel included Erin Gagnon, Isa San Miguel, and Sveta Serebryakova.</para>
<para>All survey form data were entered once by ADF&amp;G staff. A second data entry was to be completed local research assistants via remote access to the ADF&amp;G database server. Local research assistants had mixed success in this effort due to slow Internet connections and the associated tediousness of the work. As a result, the remote data entry was determined to be inefficient, and data cleaning was conducted using referential logic checks and descriptive analysis within the ADF&amp;G dataset. The original forms and partial local researcher sets were checked when an entry error was identified. By the end of June, the ADF&amp;G data entry was completed, and the referential checks were completed by the end of August.</para>
<para>Once data were entered and confirmed, information was processed with the use of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 11.5. Initial processing included the performance of standardized logic checks of the data. Logic checks are often needed in complex data sets where rules, constraints, and referential integrity do not capture all of the possible inconsistencies that may appear. Harvest data collected in numbers or animals, gallons, or buckets were converted to pounds usable weight using standard factors (see Appendix C). SPSS was also used for analyzing the survey information. Analysis included review of raw data frequencies, cross tabulations, table generation, estimation of population parameters, and calculation of confidence intervals for the estimates. Missing information was dealt with situationally. The Division of Subsistence has standardized practices for dealing with missing information, such as minimal value substitution or use of an average response for similarly characterized households. Typically, missing data are an uncommon, randomly occurring phenomenon in household surveys conducted by the division. In unusual cases where a substantial amount of survey information is missing, the household survey is treated as a nonresponse and not included in community estimates. All adjustments were documented.</para>
<para>Harvest data collected from all seven households interviewed in Karluk were very incomplete. No harvest estimates could be developed from the completed interviews. For analysis of regional trends, data from the last household survey conducted in Karluk were used (1991). Responses for the evaluative questions for Karluk were more complete and are included in this report.</para>

<methodStep><description><section><title>Data Review Workshop</title>
<para>Working with the project partners (BBNA, CRRC, and KANA) the data review workshop took place on October 12 and 13 at the Homewood Suites Hotel in Anchorage. The workshop agenda appears in Appendix D. The goal of the workshop was to review preliminary findings of the household survey and other aspects of the project, and also to discuss preparation of the final report. The workshop was well attended: 23 people participated, including representatives of 11 of the 15 study communities. Poor weather prevented anyone from Perryville, Chignik Lagoon, Nanwalek, or Old Harbor from traveling to Anchorage. Table I-7 provides a list of workshop participants. Overall, there was endorsement of most of the study findings. In a few cases, a need to follow-up in some communities to interpret some of the results was identified. Following the workshop, Division of Subsistence staff continued data review and began writing chapters of the draft final report.</para>

<methodStep><description><section><title>Organization of the Final Report</title>
<para>The next 15 chapters (Chapters II through XVI) summarize the study findings for each study community. The sequence for discussion is first geographical by subregion (Prince William Sound, Lower Cook Inlet, Kodiak Island Borough, Alaska Peninsula) and then alphabetical with each subregion. In each community chapter, the study findings are generally discussed in the following order: demography, resource harvests and uses in 2003, natural resource assessments, social conditions assessments, and other assessments. Each community chapter ends with a synopsis of key study findings or themes. Chapter XVII presents a summary of study findings for the entire area.</para>
<para>In addition to this final report, a short project findings overview was prepared and distributed in the study communities. This summary appears in this report as Appendix E. Several multi-community tables are referenced in each chapter. These appear in Chapter One for ease of reference, and include study findings about demographic characteristics (Table I-8), individual participation in subsistence activities (Table I-9), and characteristics of resource harvests and uses (Table I-10). Most of the rest of the study findings are summarized in the tables found in Appendix F. However, some community-specific tables appear in the individual community chapters. Detailed information about fish harvests by gear type was collected during the interviews. Unless discussed in particular community chapters, these data are not summarized in this report, but will be available in the division's Community Profile Database.</para>
