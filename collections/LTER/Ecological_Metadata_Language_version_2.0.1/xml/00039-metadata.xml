Proposed research will occur at La Selva Biological Reserve in Costa Rica, which is owned and operated by the Organization for Tropical Studies.&#160;In tectonically active regions of Central America, it is common for solute-rich groundwater to emerge at gradient breaks within the complex volcanic topography of mountains and foothills which intergrade with the coastal plain.  These groundwaters can significantly influence solute chemistry and related ecological and ecosystem-level processes in receiving surface waters.  Many solute-rich groundwaters are associated with underlying volcanic activity which has altered the chemistry of receiving streams throughout Central America.  Geothermally-modified groundwaters, surfacing at the gradient break between the Central Mountain range and the coastal plain at La Selva Biological Station, have high levels of P (up to 400 mg SRP L-1) and other solutes (Ca, Cl, Mg, SO4) but are not elevated in temperature.  Spatial patterns in stream solute chemistry are determined by geomorphic features of the volcanic landscape that include: upland lavas drained by P-poor streams; a gradient break (~50 m.a.s.l.), at or near where P-rich springs emerge; and lowland alluvial areas drained by streams that are both P-rich and P-poor depending on whether they receive the input of solute-rich springs. Our project is the first to determine long-term effects of nutrient enrichment in a detrital-based stream within the wet tropics.  We will continue to build upon our &#8216;long-term' (1988-present) data set on stream solute chemistry, which is the only one that we are aware of  for lowland primary rainforest of Central America.  The proposed project will build on 18 years of past research which has shown that landscape patterns in stream solute chemistry (resulting from variation in solute-rich groundwater inputs) reflect ecosystem processes such as rates of primary production and decomposition of organic material.  Specifically, we are: (1) continuing our evaluation of long-term trends in the solute chemistry of these lowland tropical streams as related to large scale climatic phenomena (e.g., El Nino Southern Oscillation Events); (2) examining how stream segments draining three major geomorphic subfeatures of the lowland tropical landscape respond to temporal (wet versus dry season) changes in precipitation; (3) examining stoichiometric mechanisms behind elevated levels of insect growth and biomass turnover rates in phosphorus-rich streams; and finally (4) concluding (and build upon) an ongoing long-term whole-stream phosphorus enrichment by determining the storage, fate and transport of the artificially-introduced phosphorus (that has been injected over an 8 year period) and examining related effects on detrital foodwebs. Stream solute chemistry and ecosystem process-oriented data are of fundamental importance to our understanding and management of tropical forests and in predicting effects of regional (and potentially global) environmental change on these threatened ecosystems.  Our long-term program will provide new insights into how large scale climatic phenomena interact with subsurface hydrologic factors and geothermal activity to influence stream solute chemistry and related ecosystem processes. We will continue to link the data sets generated from our LTREB Project to those from other long term sites for both tropical (e.g., Luquillo LTER site in Puerto Rico) and temperate research (Coweeta LTER site in North Carolina USA). Finally, the project will contribute to our ongoing environmental outreach program &#8220;Water for Life,&#8221; which includes local outreach in communities  near La Selva Biological Station and an internationally accessible web page equipped with teaching tools on river conservation and water quality andd quantity issues at the high school- level in both Spanish and English.</literalLayout></para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>LUQ</keyword><keyword>Luquillo</keyword><keyword>environmental monitoring</keyword><keyword>inorganic inputs and nutrient movements</keyword><keywordThesaurus>LTER Core</keywordThesaurus></keywordSet><intellectualRights><section><title>ADEQUATE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><para><literalLayout>The scientists, the LEF-LTER Program, and the USDA International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF) must receive adequate acknowledgement for the use of data by other scientists, and the LEF LTER program must receive two copies of any publication using that data.

It has a warm and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance. Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Catherine</givenName><surName>Pringle</surName></individualName><organizationName>University of Georgia</organizationName><positionName>Principal Investigator</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology and Department of zoology</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>GA</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(706)542-4289</phone><phone phonetype="fax">voice</phone><electronicMailAddress>cpringle@uga.edu</electronicMailAddress></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>Luquillo Experimental Forest LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.

Chip Small (PhD) - Chip Small's research focuses on integrating food web ecology and biogeochemistry using ecological stoichiometry as a conceptual framework. We have measured the phosphorus content of consumers and basal food resources (algae, leaf litter) in streams ranging widely in dissolved phosphorus. The results show the first evidence of an entire invertebrate consumer assemblage showing deviation from strict homeostasis (i.e. the insects have 2x more P in the high-P streams, where they feed on resources 6x higher in P-content). To understand the physiological implications of feeding on P-enriched food resources, we are measuring how food quality effects the growth rates and RNA content of larval chironomids, a dominant benthic consumer. To understand how the effects of P-enriched invertebrates and basal resources move through the food web, we measured nutrient excretion rates of fishes in high-P and low-P streams, to understand how fish diet, fish nutrient demand, and the degree of P-enrichment in the fish diet combines to control the rate of P-recycling by these consumers. We are also testing the hypothesis that more P is exported to the terrestrial food web in high-P streams through insect emergence. Marcia Snyder (PhD) - Tropical migratory shrimp populations are well suited to be used as environmental sensors to indicate ecological health of aquatic systems. Marcia Snyder&#8217;s dissertation proposes to use field surveys and experiments to: (1) determine if freshwater shrimp populations in relatively pristine upstream forested reaches in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica have changed from historic levels in terms of abundance, size and/or species richness; (2) determine if freshwater shrimp populations, across elevational, discharge, and solute-richness gradients exhibit differences in terms of abundance, species richness, size or fecundity; and (3) use ecological stoichiometry theory to refine shrimps role in the stream food web and (4) determine if shrimp populations directly influenced by agrochemicals exhibit differences in terms of abundance, species richness, size or fecundity from streams in protected old-growth forest. This study will refine our understanding of how macrobenthic consumers respond to anthropogenic alterations of watersheds by monitoring long-term population level changes that could occur through direct or indirect mechanisms and measuring current shrimp abundances across an anthropogenic gradient of water quality. Additionally, this study could fill a much needed gap in our knowledge of how pesticides influence the integrity of neotropical aquatic ecosystems, increase our knowledge as to how native freshwater shrimp respond in situ to chronic exposure to nutrient pulses, a range of pesticides, and a natural pH gradient.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep></methods><project scope="document"><title>STREAMS Project," La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Catherine</givenName><surName>Pringle</surName></individualName><role>Principal Investigator</role></personnel><abstract><para><literalLayout>The STREAMS Project at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica (owned and operated by the Organization for Tropical Studies, OTS) was established in 1985. Before this program, little was known about the biogeochemistry, structure, and function of Central American streams. Scientific understanding of neotropical streams has been primarily based on research conducted in South America on the Amazon (and to a lesser extent, the Orinoco). Results of the STREAMS Project comprise one of the few longterm datasets on stream solute chemistry and ecology in primary lowland rainforests of Central America. The project encompasses four areas: 1) linkages between stream ecology and biogeochemistry (e.g., Pringle 1991; Pringle and Triska 1991; Pringle et al. 1993, Triska et al. 1993; Duff et al. 1996; Genereux and Pringle 1997, Pringle and Triska 2000, Triska et al. 2006a,b, Ramirez and Pringle 2006, Ramirez et al. 2006, Stallcup et al. 2006, Ardon and Pringle in press);(2) the trophic dynamics and ecology of stream communities (Pringle and Hamazaki 1997, 1998; Pringle and Ramirez 1998; Ramirez and Pringle 1998; Rosemond et al. 1998; Rosemond et al. 2001, 2002);(3) management applications (Anderson-Olivas et al. 2006); and (4) environmental outreach on water quality and quantity issues (Pringle 1997, 1999). Pringle initiated this project in 1985 through several postdoctoral awards. In 1988, the National Science Foundation (NSF) began funding the project. It has since been funded by five consecutive NSF awards. The project is currently funded by an NSF Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology Award (2006-2011). NSF also provided two supplementary awards for the extension of research at La Selva to the Luquillo LTER site in Puerto Rico.</literalLayout></para></abstract><funding><para><literalLayout>NSF-LTREB</literalLayout></para></funding></project><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=LUQ,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>StreamNames.txt</entityName><entityDescription>Stream names</entityDescription><physical scope="document"><objectName>StreamNames.txt</objectName><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><recordDelimiter>\n</recordDelimiter><physicalLineDelimiter>\n</physicalLineDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://luq.lternet.edu/data/lterdb153/data/StreamNames.txt</url></online></distribution></physical><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><references>geoReference</references></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage id="temporalReferenceStreamNames.txt" scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1969-12-31</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>1969-12-31</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><method><methodStep><description><para><literalLayout>Provided under individual variable descriptions.
