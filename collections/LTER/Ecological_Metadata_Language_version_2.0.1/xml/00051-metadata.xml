Instrumentation consisted of a Fergusson-type weighing rain gauge. Precipitation was caught in a bucket containing ethylene glycol (to melt snow) and light oil (to prevent evaporation). As the weight of the bucket increased, the pen moved up via a spring mechanism and recorded on a  rotating chart. A snow fence was placed around the gauge to give more  accurate precipitation measurements during windy conditions.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>NWT</keyword><keyword>Niwot Ridge LTER Site</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>weather</keyword><keyword>meteorology</keyword><keyword>precipitation</keyword></keywordSet><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?sdlpreci.ml</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1981-01-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2008-12-31</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription /><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-105.643</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-105.3753</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>40.0615</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>39.9932</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><maintenance><description><para>The documentation section of this file was developed from the NWT LTER Data Directory (Symphony files DDABSTRA.WR1, DDDOCUME.WR1, DDMASTER.WR1, DDVARIAB.WR1; last updated 16 December 1991) by Mike Sannes and Rick  Ingersoll during the summer of 1993.
