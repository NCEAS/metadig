			<para>The overarching goal of this project is to understand carbon and nutrient cycles for a
				landscape on which terrestrial and freshwater systems are intimately connected in multiple
				and reciprocal ways. In the Northern Highlands region of Wisconsin, they are studying a
				spatially complex landscape in which water features make up almost half of the land area,
				with wetlands (27% of land surface) and lakes (13%) both prevalent throughout the region,
				interspersed in upland forests. Weather and limnological data from a set of 170 lakes in the
				NHLD samples summer 2004. The sampled lakes were from a random stratified subsample (N=300
				of 7588 total) of all the lakes in the NHLD. </para>

						<para>Hanson PC, Carpenter S, Cardille JA, Coe MT, Winslow LA.&#65533; 2007.&#65533; Small lakes
							dominate a random sample of regional lake characteristics. Freshwater Biology.
							52:814-22 Lakes were selected from unique Water Body Identification Codes (WBICs).
							Linear features and water bodies identified as impoundments or stream openings were
							identified from maps digitised by the Departments of Natural Resources of Michigan and
							Wisconsin (1 : 24 000 USGS 7.5&#65533; topographic quadrangles) and were excluded. More than
							7500 lakes ranging in size from about 0.01 to over 2800 ha remained in the data set.
							We used a stratified random survey, an approach consistent with the Environmental
							Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) guidelines (Larsen et al., 1994) of the U.S.
							Environmental Protection Agency, to select and sample 300 lakes from the data set as
							follows. All lakes were ordered by area and divided into 20 bins of equal population.
							From each bin, 15 lakes were chosen at random. Because of logistical issues in
							travelling to many lakes scattered over a wide geographical region, we clustered lakes
							into 31 geographically small regions of about 150 km2 each. The order of regions
							sampled was randomised to reduce correlation of geographic region with time. For any
							one sampling date we visited only one region, although not all lakes in a region could
							be visited on a single trip. After all 31 regions were visited, the regions were again
							selected at random, and lakes previously not visited were sampled. There were 45
							sampling days spread between May 20 and August 19. Some lakes that were chosen for
							sampling could not be visited. Difficulty portaging the sampling gear to a lake or
							failure to gain access to a lake through private property were reasons for abandoning
							a sampling effort. Lakes were sampled at their approximate geographic centre. Lake
							depth and water clarity were measured with a Secchi disk. Our measurement of lake
							depth was neither a measurement of the maximum nor the mean depth. Because the
							measurement was made in the middle of the lake and most lakes in the region tend to be
							bowl shaped, our measurement was probably between mean and maximum depth. Dissolved
							oxygen (DO) and thermal profiles were obtained from a YSI Model 58 (YSI, Inc., Yellow
							Springs, OH, U.S.A.) metre (DO air calibrated; temperature calibrated in the
							laboratory), and the approximate middle of the epilimnion was estimated from the
							profile. Thermal stratification was calculated from the thermal profile according to
							the methods listed on the Internet at the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological
							Research (NTL-LTER) program Web site (http://lter.limnology.wisc.edu). Water samples
							for later analyses (Table 1, chemical variables) were obtained from the middle of the
							epilimnion, using a peristaltic pump. For samples that required filtration [dissolved
							inorganic carbon (DIC), DOC, cations and anions], a 0.45 &#956;m filter was attached
							in-line. All samples were refrigerated upon returning to the vehicle, and samples for
							total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were preserved by acidification. Acid
							neutralizing capacity (ANC) and pH were determined the day of sampling by Gran
							alkalinity titration (for ANC) and measurement by pH probe (Accumet 950; Fisher
							Scientific, Hanover Park, IL U.S.A.). pH was not air equilibrated. DIC and DOC were
							measured with a carbon analyzer (TOC-V; Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD,
							U.S.A.). TN and TP were measured with a segmented flow auto-analyzer (Astoria-Pacific,
							Inc., Clackamas, OR, U.S.A.). Anions were measured using an ion chromatograph (DX500;
							Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, U.S.A.), and cations using mass spectrometry
							(ICP-MS; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Shelton, CT, U.S.A.). Details of
							chemical analyses are available on the Internet at the NTL-LTER Web site listed above.
							To correct for bias introduced by not sampling all 300 lakes, we replaced missing data
							using multiple imputation (Levy, 1999). Multiple imputation is a technique for
							estimating the uncertainty of imputed variables. For each variable for each lake not
							sampled in a given bin, we chose at random (with replacement) a value from lakes
							sampled in that bin. We repeated the imputation 1000 times to provide a distribution
							of estimates for each variable in the lakes not sampled. The distribution mean for
							each variable in each lake was used in the calculation of the median for the regional
							lake population. We chose to present the median for the 300 lakes because
							distributions tended to be highly skewed. For comparison purposes, we also calculated
							the median from sampled lakes only (i.e. excluding imputed data). The mean cumulative
							distributions for some variables, including 95% confidence intervals, were plotted
							from the 1000 cumulative distributions generated by multiple imputation. We fit a
							Pareto distribution to the regional lake area data set to compare the size
							distribution of NHLD lakes with those of other regions. We used the maximum likelihood
							estimator for parameter estimates (Bernardo and Smith, 2000). Of particular interest
							is the parameter (&#946;) that describes the logarithmic decline in number of lakes with
							lake area, because this parameter has been used previously (Downing et al., 2006,
							Table 1) to compare lake area distributions among regions and to estimate the global
							abundance of lakes. Where indicated, results have been area weighted to reflect the
							influence of lake size. For correlations, data were transformed (log10) to normalise
							distributions and linearise relationships. Shoreline development factor (SDF), an
							index of the irregular shape of lakes, was calculated for each lake according to Kalff
							(2002). The minimum SDF, 1, indicates a lake is a perfect circle. </para>

						<para>Lab analyses: Lake samples were measured unfiltered. Instrument used: Trout Lake
							spectrophotometer (make and model?). Measurements were made using a 10-cm pathlength
							cuvette cell for all samples. For samples where absorbance was deemed too high, the
							measurement was repeated using a 1-cm pathlength cuvette cell. Millipure (DIW?) water
							blanks were run periodically on both 1-cm and 10-cm cells as a blank check. Absorption
							values were converted to absorption coefficients and corrected for scattering due to
							particles following the technique of Zhang, Y.L., and Qin, B.Q. 2007. Variations in
							spectral slope in lake taihu, a large subtropical shallow lake in China. Journal of
							Great Lakes Research 33(2): 483-496. </para>
