        CGCM1, and its control climate are described by Flato et al.
        (1999). The atmospheric component of the model is essentially
        GCMII described by McFarlane et al. (1992). It is a spectral
        model with triangular truncation at wave number 32 (yielding a
        surface grid resolution of roughly 3.7 degrees x3.7 degrees )
        and 10 vertical levels. The ocean component is based on the GFDL
        MOM1.1 code and has a resolution of approximately 1.8 degrees
        x1.8 degrees  and 29 vertical levels. The model uses heat and
        water flux adjustments obtained from uncoupled ocean and
        atmosphere model runs (of 10 years and 4000 years duration
        respectively), followed by an `adaption' procedure in which the
        flux adjustment fields are modified by a 14 year integration of
        the coupled model. A multi-century control simulation with the
        coupled model has been performed using the present-day CO2
        concentration to evaluate the stability of the coupled model's
        climate, and to compare the modelled climate and its variability
        to that observed.  An ensemble of four transient climate change
        simulations has been performed and is described in Boer et al.
        (1999a; b). Three of these simulations use an effective
        greenhouse gas forcing change corresponding to that observed
        from 1850 to the present, and a forcing change corresponding to
        an increase of CO2 at a rate of 1% per year (compounded)
        thereafter until year 2100. The direct forcing effect of
        sulphate aerosols is also included by increasing the surface
        albedo (as in Reader and Boer, 1999) based on loadings from the
        sulphur cycle model of Langner and Rodhe (1991). The fourth
        simulation considers the effect of greenhouse gas forcing only.
        The change in climate predicted by a model clearly depends
        directly on this specification of greenhouse gas (and aerosol)
        forcing, and of course these are not well known. The
        prescription described above is similar to the IPCC
        "business as usual" scenario, and using a standard
        scenario allows the results of this model to be compared to
        those of other modelling groups around the world. Some initial
        results from these simulations are presented below.  The climate
        sensitivity of CGCM1 is about 3.5 degrees C.</para><para>From the IPCC website:  The B2 world is one of increased
        concern for environmental and social sustainability.  Education
        and welfare programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in
        mortality and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population
        reaches about 10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both
        the United Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per
        capita grows at an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by
        2050. By 2100 the global economy might expand to reach some
        US$250 trillion.  International income differences decrease,
        although not as rapidly as in scenarios of higher global
        convergence (A1, B1). Local inequity is reduced considerably
        through the development of stronger community support networks.
        Generally high educational levels promote both development and
        environmental protection. Indeed, environmental protection is
        one of the few remaining truly international priorities.
        However, strategies to address global environmental challenges
        are less successful than in B1, as governments have difficulty
        designing and implementing agreements that combine environmental
        protection with mutual economic benefits.  The B2 storyline
        presents a particularly favorable climate for community
        initiative and social innovation, especially in view of high
        educational levels. Technological frontiers are pushed less than
        in A1 and B1 and innovations are also regionally more
        heterogeneous. Globally, investment in R&amp; continues its
        current declining trend, and mechanisms for international
        diffusion of technology and know-how remain weaker than in
        scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher than in scenario A2). Some
        regions with rapid economic development and limited natural
        resources place particular emphasis on technology development
        and bilateral co-operation. Technical change is therefore
        uneven. The energy intensity of GDP declines at about one
        percent per year, in line with the average historical experience
        of the last two centuries.  Land-use management becomes better
        integrated at the local level in the B2 world. Urban and
        transport infrastructure is a particular focus of community
        innovation, contributing to a low level of car dependence and
        less urban sprawl. An emphasis on food self-reliance contributes
        to a shift in dietary patterns towards local products, with
        reduced meat consumption in countries with high population
        densities.  Energy systems differ from region to region,
        depending on the availability of natural resources. The need to
        use energy and other resources more efficiently spurs the
        development of less carbon-intensive technology in some regions.
        Environment policy cooperation at the regional level leads to
        success in the management of some transboundary environmental
        problems, such as acidification due to SO2, especially to
        sustain regional self-reliance in agricultural production.
        Regional cooperation also results in lower emissions of NOx and
        VOCs, reducing the incidence of elevated tropospheric ozone
        levels. Although globally the energy system remains
        predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is a gradual
        transition away from the current share of fossil resources in
        world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction in carbon
        intensity.  Data are available for the following periods:
