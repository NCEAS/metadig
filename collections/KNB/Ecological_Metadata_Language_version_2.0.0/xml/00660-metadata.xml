        consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM, a
        thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model
        (Abe-Ouchi et al., 1996). The spatial resolution is T21 spectral
        truncation (roughly 5.6 degrees  latitude/longitude) and 20
        vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8
        degrees  horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic
        part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water
        exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate.
        The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the
        k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM)
        (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with
        absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol
        particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate
        aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the
        sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2
        micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by
        an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical
        distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant
        in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of
        greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2.  Three
        integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the
        control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of
        greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and
        the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment
        GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually
        increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the
        experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well
        as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering
        (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the
        way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not
        included in any experiment.  The scenario of atmospheric
        concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is
        given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase
        in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890
        to 1990 and is increased by 1 percent / yr (compound) after
        1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of
        sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a
        sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic
        patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission
        rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the
        2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is
        interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to
        give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission
        rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The
        sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts
        from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate
        concentration is ignored.  Discussion on the results of the
        experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate
        sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs
        is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global-Mean Temperature,
        Precipitation and CO2 Changes (w.r.t. 1961-90) for the CCSR/NIES model.</para><para>From the IPCC website:  The A1 Family storyline is a case of
        rapid and successful economic development, in which regional
        averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions
        between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this
        scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely
        linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small
        families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population
        grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven
        billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of
        retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in
        private pension systems.  The global economy expands at an
        average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is
        approximately the same as average global growth since 1850,
        although the conditions that lead to a global economic in
        productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history.
        Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the
        high average level of income per capita contributes to a great
        improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the
        majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In
        particular, many communities could face some of the problems of
        social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the
        20th century and in many places income growth could come with
        increased pressure on the global commons.  Energy and mineral
        resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid
        technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to
        produce a given level of output and increases the economically
        recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per
        unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent.
        With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift
        initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat
        and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with
        increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes
        also translate into high car ownership, sprawling
        suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and
        internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per
        capita. These factors along with high wages result in a
        considerable intensification of agriculture.  Three scenario
        groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the
        uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion
        technologies in this rapidly changing world.  Near-term
        investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities
        into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration
        or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of
        energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions,
        but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the
        variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive
        scenario group A1tI, emissions approach those of the A2
        scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor
        productivity or of rapid progress in "post-fossil"
        energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of
        B1 and B2.  These scenario variants have been introduced into
        the A1 storyline because of its "high growth with high
        tech" nature, where differences in alternative technology
        developments translate into large differences in future GHG
        emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in
        this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a
        utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy.

        "management" - and marketing - of natural and
