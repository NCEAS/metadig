        et al., 1996, 1999) has recently been used for a number of more
        sophisticated climate change simulations. These start from 1880
        to avoid the "cold start problem".  This version of
        the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in
        the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to
        earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global
        mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02
        degrees C/century. Note that the model uses flux correction.
        The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal
        resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees).
        The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21
        levels.  The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed
        layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the
        high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995,
        Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model
        combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into
        an "equivalent" CO2 concentration. Observed
        concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a
        projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year
        compounding increase of equivalent CO2.  Another model
        experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from
        atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is
        included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to
        the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995)
        and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are
        the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the
        chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a
        present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4
        W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas
        forcing of about 2 W/m^2.  The magnitude of the 20th century
        warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed
        reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing
        from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect
        effect and the effect of soot.  The climate sensitivity of
        CSIRO-Mk2 is about 4.3 degrees C (Watterson et al.,1997).</para><para>The central elements of the B1 future are a high level of
        environmental and social consciousness combined with a globally
        coherent approach to sustainable development. A strong welfare
        net prevents social exclusion on the basis of poverty. However,
        counter-currents may develop and in some places people may not
        conform to the main social and environmental intentions of the
        mainstream in this scenario family. Particular effort is devoted
        to increasing resource efficiency. Comprehensive incentive
        systems, combined with advances in international institutions,
        permit the rapid diffusion of cleaner technology. R and D to
        this end is also enhanced together with education and capacity
        building for clean and equitable development. Organizational
        measures are adopted to reduce material wastage, maximizing
        reuse and recycling. The combination of technical and
        organizational change yields high levels of material and energy
        saving as well as reductions in pollution. Labor productivity
        also improves as a byproduct of these efforts. Variants
        considered within the B1 family of scenarios include different
        rates of GDP growth and dematerialization (e.g., energy
        intensity declines). The demographic transition to low mortality
        and fertility occurs at the same rate as in A1 but for slightly
        different reasons, motivated partly by social and environmental
        concerns. Global population reaches nine billion by 2050 and
        declines to about seven billion by 2100. This is a world with
        high levels of economic activity and significant and deliberate
        progress toward international and national income equality.
        Global income per capita in 2050 averages US$13,000; somewhat
        lower than in A1. A higher proportion of this income is spent on
        services rather than on material goods, and on quality rather
        than quantity, because of less emphasis on material goods and
        also higher resource prices.  The B1 storyline sees a relatively
        smooth transition to alternative energy systems as conventional
        oil resources decline. There is extensive use of conventional
        and unconventional gas as the cleanest fossil resource during
        the transition, but the major push is towards post fossil
        technologies driven in large part by environmental concerns.
        Given the high environmental consciousness and institutional
        effectiveness in the B1 storyline, environmental quality is
        high, as most potentially negative environmental aspects of
        rapid development are anticipated and dealt with effectively
        locally, nationally, and internationally. For example,
        transboundary air pollution (acid rain) is basically eliminated
        in the long-term. Land-use is carefully managed to counteract
        the impacts of activities potentially damaging to the
        environment. Cities are compact and designed for public and
        non-motorized transport, with suburban developments tightly
        controlled. Strong incentives for low-input, low-impact
        agriculture along with maintenance of large areas of wilderness
        contribute to high food prices with much lower levels of meat
        consumption than those in A1. These proactive local and regional
        environmental measures and policies also lead to relatively low
        GHG emissions even in the absence of explicit interventions
        directed at mitigating climate change.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>global climate change</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>1. The IPCC Data Distribution Centre permits the research
