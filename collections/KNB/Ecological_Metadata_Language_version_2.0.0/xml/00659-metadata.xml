        CGCM1, and its control climate are described by Flato et al.
        (1999). The atmospheric component of the model is essentially
        GCMII described by McFarlane et al. (1992). It is a spectral
        model with triangular truncation at wave number 32 (yielding a
        surface grid resolution of roughly 3.7 degrees x3.7 degrees) and
        10 vertical levels. The ocean component is based on the GFDL
        MOM1.1 code and has a resolution of approximately 1.8 degrees
        x1.8 degrees and 29 vertical levels. The model uses heat and
        water flux adjustments obtained from uncoupled ocean and
        atmosphere model runs (of 10 years and 4000 years duration
        respectively), followed by an `adaption' procedure in which the
        flux adjustment fields are modified by a 14 year integration of
        the coupled model. A multi-century control simulation with the
        coupled model has been performed using the present-day CO2
        concentration to evaluate the stability of the coupled model's
        climate, and to compare the modelled climate and its variability
        to that observed.  An ensemble of four transient climate change
        simulations has been performed and is described in Boer et al.
        (1999a; b). Three of these simulations use an effective
        greenhouse gas forcing change corresponding to that observed
        from 1850 to the present, and a forcing change corresponding to
        an increase of CO2 at a rate of 1% per year (compounded)
        thereafter until year 2100. The direct forcing effect of
        sulphate aerosols is also included by increasing the surface
        albedo (as in Reader and Boer, 1999) based on loadings from the
        sulphur cycle model of Langner and Rodhe (1991). The fourth
        simulation considers the effect of greenhouse gas forcing only.
        The change in climate predicted by a model clearly depends
        directly on this specification of greenhouse gas (and aerosol)
        forcing, and of course these are not well known. The
        prescription described above is similar to the IPCC
        "business as usual" scenario, and using a standard
        scenario allows the results of this model to be compared to
        those of other modelling groups around the world. Some initial
        results from these simulations are presented below.  The climate
        sensitivity of CGCM1 is about 3.5 degrees C.  For the A2
        emissions scenario the main emphasis is on a strengthening of
        regional and local culture, with a return to family values in
        many regions. The A2 world consolidates into a series of roughly
        continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots.
        In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to
        reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing
        to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards ncreased
        investment in education and science and growth in economic
        productivity. Social and political structures diversify with
        some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced
        income inequality, while others move towards "lean"
        government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although
        some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control
        and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees
        more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or
        B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology
        diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and
        hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the
        emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline
        only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this
        scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the
        A1 andB1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in
        2100.Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in
        others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments,
        culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and
        mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies,
        while those poor in resources place very high priority on
        minimizing import dependence through technological innovation to
        improve resource efficiency and make use of substitute inputs.
        The fuel mix in different regions is determined primarily by
        resource availability. And divisions among regions persist in
        terms of their mix of technologies, with high-income but
        resource-poor regions shifting toward advanced post fossil
        technologies (renewables in regions of large land availability,
        nuclear in densely populated, resource poor regions) and
        low-income resource-rich regions generally relying on older
        fossil technologies.With substantial food requirements,
        agricultural productivity is one of the main focus areas for
        innovation and RD efforts in this future. Initially high levels
        of soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through
        the local development of more sustainable high-yield
        agriculture.Although attention is given to potential local and
        regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions.
        For example, sulfur and particulate emissions are reduced in
        Asia due to impacts on human health and agricultural production
        but increase in Africa as a result of the intensified
        exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. The A2 world
        sees high energy and carbon intensity, and correspondingly high
        GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions are the highest of all four
        scenario families.  Data are available for the following
        periods:  1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099, mean
