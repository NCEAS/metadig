 <abstract><para>The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes a litter bag study on shoot decomposition, collected as part of the decomposition section of MERP.
	The high primary productivity in wetlands ensures that plant litter production and decomposition are important factors in wetland nutrient budgets. There are 3 components of the litter pool in prairie wetlands: standing litter, fallen litter, and dissolved organic compounds that leach from both standing and fallen litter (Davis and van der Valk, 1978). Material enters the standing litter compartment with the death of the leaf or shoots. In prairie marshes, litter is transferred from the standing litter compartment to fallen litter primarily through fragmentation by wind, snow, and ice action. In areas of high muskrat activity, feeding and house building can result in living plant tissues directly entering the fallen litter stage. Once within the fallen litter compartment, decomposition rates increase due to the growth of bacteria, fungi, and other consumers on the litter particles. (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). 
	The MERP decomposition studies are a series of short-term studies examining the decomposition rates of both above- and belowground components of the dominant emergent species and the transfer of litter from the standing to the fallen litter compartment within the experimental cells (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Three types of decomposition studies were conducted: litterbag studies, dead standing litter (clip plot) studies and matching stems (permanent clips) studies.This short-term litter bag study was conducted to examine the decomposition of emergent macrophytes (Typha glauca syn. Typha &#215; glauca, Phragmites australis, Scolochloa festucacea, Scirpus lacustris and Scirpus maritimus syn Schoenoplectus maritimus) that dominated during the first year of reflooding (1985; Nelson, 1988; Wrubleski, Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, unpublished).

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><title>MERP Shoot decomposition litter bag study data (1986-1988) methods</title>
 <para>This short-term litter bag study was conducted to examine the decomposition of emergent macrophytes (Typha glauca syn. Typha &#215; glauca, Phragmites australis, Scolochloa festucacea, Scirpus lacustris and Scirpus maritimus syn Schoenoplectus maritimus) that dominated during the first year of reflooding (1985; Nelson, 1988; Wrubleski, Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, unpublished).</para>
 <para>Procedures followed in the 1986-1988 Shoot Decomposition Study were the same as those described for the 1985-1987 &#8216;Decomposition of Mud-flat Species&#8217; litterbag study (stored in a separate data package on the KNB). Dead above-water shoots of each of the five emergent macrophytes were collected on 23 April 1986. A subsample of each species was retained as a control for nutrient analysis. A second subsample of material was oven dried at 80 degrees Celcius and used to estimate the initial oven-dry weight of each bag (note that this data is not included in the data file; see the fresh_wt metadata for the fresh to oven dry weight conversion factor). One hundred and fifty litter bags were made for each species. Thirty litter bag sites were selected for each species, three in each of the 10 marshes. Sites were selected to span the range of elevations in which each species was observed during 1985, and the same litter bag sites were used as in the 1985-1987 study (a yellow ribbon on each site marker post separated litter bags from the 1985-1987 and 1986-1988 studies). In addition, thirty new sites will be established at locations selected to range across elevations over which each species was observed growing during 1985.  For each species, sites were within stands of the same species. Five litter bags for each species were deployed at each sampling site on 26 May &#8211; 3 June 1986. Bags were retrieved 28 May &#8211; 5 June (48 hours), 14 &#8211; 18 July (49 days), 20 &#8211; 21 July 1987 (418 days) and 30 &#8211; 31 May 1988 (730 days) (note that although five litter bags were deployed per site, there were only four collection dates; therefore, on the final collection date, often two litter bags were collected. As this study was never published, no reason can be given as to why this change in methodology was made and therefore, the data should be used with caution). Water depth was recorded at the time of litter bag collection (Nelson, 1988; Wrubleski, Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, unpublished).</para>
 <para>Lab methods followed that conducted for the 1985-1987 litter bag study. Similar to the 1985-1987 &#8216;Decomposition of Mud-flat Species&#8217; litterbag study, to reduce the number of samples that were analyzed for nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon, ground litter samples were pooled by species, water depth and collection date. Water depths were stratified into 30 cm intervals, i.e. 0 cm = unflooded, 1-30 cm = shallow, 31-60 cm = medium and &gt;60 cm = deep. The percent dry weight, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon remaining could be calculated for each bag based on values from the initial control samples (Nelson, 1988; Wrubleski, Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, unpublished).</para>
 <para>Notes on reading the data:</para>
 <para>-Entries left blank in columns between 2 commas represent that the sample was not able to be taken and/or recorded properly and is considered 'lost' information (e.g. where there is no lb_num and therefore no fresh_wt for a particular litterbag), or, where cell=0, all other columns are blank, except for nutrients, because this represents a control litter bag.</para>
 <para>-Zeros used as values represent that a particular parameter was measured (e.g. water depth) and the value was zero, or as a categorical variable (i.e. for cell_num, 0=control)</para>

 <para>Introduction</para>
 <para>Good et al. (1978) and Greeson et al. (1978) were among the first to summarize the state of our understanding in freshwater wetland ecology. They emphasized the need for expanded interdisciplinary research in freshwater wetlands. Ten years later, van der Valk (1989), in Northern Prairie Wetlands, focused specifically on prairie wetlands and the influence of water-level changes on the dynamics and productivity of these systems.</para>
 <para>Primary production, secondary production, vegetation composition and distribution, animal use, and nutrient budgets are all affected as water levels rise and fall with variation in precipitation. Ranging from tiny potholes to huge lacustrine complexes, prairie wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems (Murkin, 1989a). Their importance as wildlife production areas has drawn considerable attention to their conservation and management (Weller, 1978; Weller, 1981). This attention has increased in recent years with the need for information on the overall functions and values of wetlands within the prairie landscape (Murkin, 1998). Understanding wetland values is critical to the development of comprehensive wetland conservation programs. In addition, the ongoing destruction of wetlands through drainage, urban sprawl, and other human-induced changes has added a great deal of urgency to the need for a better understanding of the ecology and management of all remaining wetland areas (Murkin et al., 2000a).</para>
 <para>Objectives</para>
 <para>Recognizing the need for an improved understanding of prairie wetland ecology, the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was initiated in 1979 as a joint project of</para>
 <para>Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station (Murkin et al., 1984). The MERP was designed as a long-term replicated experiment addressing the impacts of various water levels on the main components of the prairie wetland ecosystem. The overall objective of MERP was to document the changes that occur within a prairie wetland during a simulated wet-dry cycle (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). More specifically, MERP was designed to determine the storage (pools) and movement (fluxes) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) during the various stages of the cycle (Murkin et al., 2000a). Specific objectives for each of the major ecosystem components were as follows:</para>
 <para>1. Hydrology: to estimate the terms of the water budget during all stages of the wet-dry cycle: surface water in and out, ground water in and out, change in storage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration.</para>
 <para>2. Water chemistry: to estimate the concentrations of N, P, C, and major ions in both surface and substrate pore-water pools and to monitor changes in these pools during the wet-dry cycle.</para>
 <para>3. Macrophytes: to estimate annual above- and below ground macrophyte productivity and standing crops and subsequent changes related to the wet-dry cycle. Storage and movement of N, P, and C in macrophytes during the wet-dry cycle also were determined.</para>
 <para>4. Macrophyte litter: to estimate the annual production of above- and belowground macrophyte litter and the loss and uptake of N, P, and C to and from the litter compartment.</para>
 <para>5. Algae: to estimate algal standing crops and productivity (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon, and metaphyton) during the various stages of the wet-dry cycle.</para>
 <para>6. Invertebrates: to estimate standing crops of invertebrates (nekton, benthos, and emerging insects) during the various phases of the wet-dry cycle.</para>
 <para>7. Vertebrates: to monitor use by waterfowl, coots, blackbirds, and muskrats in response to habitat changes during the wet- dry cycle.</para>
 <para>The MERP experimental design and field-sampling protocols were developed to meet these objectives. Nutrient data were used to construct nutrient budgets for the experimental cells. Several additional objectives beyond those related specifically to nutrient storage and movement also were addressed. Examples are rate of recovery of plant communities following drawdown (Welling et al., 1988a), habitat use by various vertebrate groups during specific stages of the wet-dry cycle (Clark and Kroeker, 1993), and the effect of the wet-dry cycle on individual invertebrate species (Ross and Murkin, 1993; Murkin et al., 2000a).</para>
 <para>Study Area</para>
 <para>The MERP study area was located on the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba, Canada (50&#61616;11'N, 98&#176;19'W). The Delta Marsh is a large lacustrine marsh (&#61627;15,000 ha) along the southern shore of Lake Manitoba (see Batt, 2000). The marsh is of Pleistocene origin and is a remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz (L&#246;ve and L&#246;ve, 1954, Ehrlich et al., 1957). An important feature of the marsh is that its water level has been stabilized for many years (due to installation of a water-control structure on Lake Manitoba in 1961), resulting in lake marsh conditions described by van der Valk and Davis (1978) over much of its area (Murkin et al., 2000a). The site for the MERP experimental complex was chosen because of several features. First, the area had representative portions of shallow- and deep-marsh zones characteristic of the Delta Marsh and other northern prairie marshes. Second, the area was remote and completely within the private ownership of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station, thus ensuring access for researchers, while affording effective control of trespass and disturbance. Third, the site was served by an existing road system. This road system was crucial, given the large number of individuals working on the site each day; the large numbers and volumes of water, soil, vegetation, and animal samples to be handled; and the logistics of transporting and maintaining sampling devices. Finally, the existing road provided the northern boundary of the experimental cells, thereby reducing construction costs. The water levels used in the experiments were chosen to reflect conditions that had occurred naturally during the previous 5 decades. Thus, the experimental site and design has provided information that is relevant to any future management efforts on the Delta Marsh, specifically, and wetland management in general.</para>
 <para>The experimental cell complex consisted of 10 contiguous 4-6 ha marsh units (Cells 1-10), created in 1979 by building a series of dikes along the northern edge of the main marsh. The diked experimental cells were numbered 1 to 10 from west to east. The approximate dimension of each diked cell was 150m x 300m (see Table 1 for the specific dimensions of each cell). Disturbance due to dike construction was confined to the dikes and a 10m buffer strip on each side of the dike. Each diked cell was equipped with a water control structure and electric pump with automatic controls to adjust and maintain (&#61617;2cm) water levels according to the schedule (see Table 2). Besides the diked cells, two undiked areas of similar size within the Delta Marsh (Cells 11 &amp; 12) were monitored as reference cells (i.e. reference cells to the unmanipulated Delta Marsh). The vegetation within the diked cells prior to the experimental treatments was comparable to the reference cells and main Delta Marsh (Pederson 1981; Murkin et al., 2000a).</para>
 <para>Experimental Design</para>
 <para>The general MERP objective was to monitor the response of various aspects of the wetland ecosystem to a series of water-level manipulations intended to simulate the wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands. The schedule for water-level treatments and the number of replicates for each treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The study was basically divided into four phases. The first two phases (baseline and deep flooding) were designed to provide background information on the experimental cells and to bring all cells to a similar condition (lake marsh stage) before the actual wet-dry cycle was applied during the last two phases (drawdown and reflooding; Murkin et al., 2000a). The four phases of the experimental design were as follows:</para>
 <para>a.	Baseline year (1980-1981):</para>
 <para>During the first year of the study (1980), the control structures were left open and water levels within the cells were allowed to track the levels of the Delta Marsh. This method provided a year of baseline data before the actual water-level manipulations began. Two of the cells (3 and 7) were kept at baseline levels for a second year (1981) to allow for comparison of different durations of drawdown later in the study (see Table 3).</para>
 <para>b.	Deep flooding (aka Conditioning Period; 1981-1983):</para>
 <para>Following the baseline year(s), all diked cells were flooded to ~ 1 m above normal for a period of 2 years (Table 2). These levels were designed to flood the existing cattail (Typha spp.) stands to a depth of 1 m and were similar to actual natural high-water levels that occurred in the Delta Marsh in the 1950s. This deep flooding was intended to kill the existing emergent vegetation and set all the cells to the lake marsh stage described by van der Valk and Davis (1978). In part, deep flooding was also an attempt to reduce the variability in vegetation among the experimental cells prior to drawdown.</para>
 <para>c.	Drawdown (1983-1984):</para>
 <para>After the second year of above-normal flooding, the cells were drawn down (completely dewatered) by adjusting the water levels to 50 cm below the long-term level of the Delta Marsh (Table 2). Most cells were exposed to a 2-year drawdown. Two cells (3 and 7) were drawn down for 1 year to allow comparisons between drawdowns of 1- and 2-year durations. The drawdowns allowed vegetation to reestablish on the marsh substrates (Welling et al., 1988a, b).</para>
 <para>d.	Reflooding (1985-1989):</para>
 <para>It has been assumed that the rate at which prairie wetlands proceed through the various stages of the wet-dry cycle is determined by water depth, with deeper wetlands moving to the lake marsh stage more quickly than shallowly flooded wetlands (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). Following drawdown, the cells were reflooded to three different levels (Table 3). The normal level was the long-term mean level (247.50 m above mean sea level [AMSL]) of the Delta Marsh and the medium (247.80 m) and high (248.10 m) levels were 30 and 60 cm above the long-term mean, respectively (Murkin et al., 2000a).</para>
 <para>To ensure replicated treatments (on a hydrologic basis) during the reflooding experiments in 1985-1989, water-level treatments were assigned to the experimental cells as follows: the two low-water treatments with a 1-year drawdown (Table 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental complex, and the remaining treatments were then assigned to the other cells to ensure that each cell within a water-level treatment had a similar hydrologic setting (i.e. both low cells with 1-year drawdowns were flanked by cells with low and high treatments, both low 2-year drawdown cells by low and medium treatments, all medium treatment cells by high- and low-treatment cells, and the high-treatment cells by medium and low cells). This replicated hydrology is discussed in more detail in Kadlec (1983, 1993). The treatment assignments for the 1985-1989 period (Table 3) determined the water-level assignments during the early phases of the MERP experiments from 1981 to 1984 (Table 2).</para>
 <para>Long-term Monitoring Program</para>
 <para>The Scientific Team designed a program of standardized methods to monitor the experimental cells throughout the period of study. The basic strategy was to collect a comparable data set from year to year in each experimental cell for each of the major components being monitored, including hydrology, water chemistry, macrophytes, macrophyte litter, algae, invertebrates and vertebrates (Murkin et al., 2000a; Murkin, 1989b). The MERP long-term monitoring program involved a variety of techniques that were used to provide comparable datasets across the experimental cells and over the 10 years of fieldwork. Some of the techniques used were new, but most were adopted from other researchers. All have been modified to suit the needs for efficiency, economy and practicality for long-term large-scale ecosystem research (Murkin et al., 2000b). Each component has a section in the MERP Data Archive describing the techniques used.</para>
 <para>Short-term Studies</para>
 <para>Besides the long-term monitoring program, short-term studies were an integral component of the overall MERP program. Some of these studies provided background information needed to develop the long-term monitoring program (Pederson, 1981; Wrubleski, 1984). Some were integrated into the long-term monitoring program (Murkin, 1983a; Galinato, 1985; Hosseini, 1986; Welling, 1987; Merendino, 1989). Several aspects of the long-term monitoring program following drawdown began as short-term studies (Kroeker, 1988; Squires, 1991; Wrubleksi, 1991). Many of the short-term studies, however, were initiated because of questions raised by the long-term monitoring program. This approach was particularly true for studies of invertebrates (Nelson, 1982; Neckles, 1984; Bicknese, 1987; Campeau, 1990) and emergent macrophytes (Neill, 1988; Neill, 1992). Many of the short-term studies were conducted by graduate studies, a list of which can be found in merp_pubs_appx3_prairie_wetland_ecology_pdfa.pdf and whose theses can be found in the merp_publications_theses file (Murkin et al., 2000a).</para>
 <para>Main Transects, Work Lanes and Sampling Procedure</para>
 <para>To aid in the assignment of sampling stations, each cell was divided into 10 zones. Zone boundaries were parallel to the southern dike. To determine the zones, 10 areas of equal width were established between a line 10 m north of the south dike and a second line 10 m south of the road on the northern edge of the cell. These zones were permanently marked so they could be located from year to year.</para>
 <para>Each year, ten transects were randomly established within each cell, 1 per zone, numbered from north to south. These transects or &#8216;work lanes&#8217; were used for all types of routine sampling, in order to minimize disturbance and confine it within a designated region. All sampling took place as near as possible to the work lane. When a sampling point was some distance from the work lane, a path perpendicular to the work lane was established. Work lanes were reassigned each fall following the last day of sampling (Murkin, 1989b; Murkin et al., 2000b).</para>
 <para>A standard sampling procedure was maintained during all transect sampling. One or two random transects in each cell were sampled, repeating the same method for each cell until all samples were secured, rather than sampling all transects in a cell before moving on to the next cell. This randomized any effect due to time during the sampling period. As standard procedure, water depth at the sampling site was recorded during all types of sampling (Murkin, 1983b).</para>
