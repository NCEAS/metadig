        used the new Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments
        represent a large step forward in the way climate change is
        modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario
        construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major
        difficulties that were associated with the previous generations
        of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa
        IPCC 1992) climate change experiments.  HadCM2 has a spatial
        resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude)
        and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73
        grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about
        417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and
        South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42).  The
        equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the
        global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2
        concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this
        quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat
        lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a
        'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model
        with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative
        forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley
        Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with
        forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et
        al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995.  The greenhouse gas only
        integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the
        greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further
        series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent
        CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate
        aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in
        forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the
        early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The
        addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols
        represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic
        sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface
        albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to
        Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect
        effects of aerosols were not simulated.  The modelled control
        climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air
        temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04
        degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such
        experiments.  HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous
        generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre
        (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995).  The experiments
        performed have simulated the observed climate system using
        estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995)
        and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's
        sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The
        agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record
        and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS
        than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the
        observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than
        HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record.  The climate
        sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees C</para><para>Like B1, the B2 world is one of increased concern for
        environmental and social sustainability, but the character of
        this world differs substantially.  Education and welfare
        programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality
        and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about
        10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United
        Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at
        an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100
        the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion.
        International income differences decrease, although not as
        rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1).
        Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development
        of stronger community support networks.  Generally high
        educational levels promote both development and environmental
        protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few
        remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to
        address global environmental challenges are less successful than
        in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing
        agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual
        economic benefits.  The B2 storyline presents a particularly
        favorable climate for community initiative and social
        innovation, especially in view of high educational levels.
        Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and
        innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally,
        investment in R and D continues its current declining trend, and
        mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and
        know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher
        than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic
        development and limited natural resources place particular
        emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation.
        Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of
        GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the
        average historical experience of the last two centuries.
        Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level
        in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a
        particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low
        level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on
        food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns
        towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in
        countries with high population densities.  Energy systems differ
        from region to region, depending on the availability of natural
        resources. The need to use energy and other resources more
        efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive
        technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at
        the regional level leads to success in the management of some
        transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due
        to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in
        agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in
        lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of
        elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy
        system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is
        a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil
        resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction
        in carbon intensity.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>global climate change</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>1. The IPCC Data Distribution Centre permits the research
