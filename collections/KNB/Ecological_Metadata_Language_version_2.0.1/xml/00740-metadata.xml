The goal of this data set is to provide a comprehensive long-term data set on demographic variation and covariation for a guild of desert winter annual plants. Germination, survival fecundity and seed bank dynamics have been assessed on a set of permanent plots since 1982 at the Desert Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona. Data is provided for individual plant including germination date, death date, fecundity, viable seed bank and in some years, Cartesian coordinates within plots.

Site description: Permanent quadrats were established in 1982 at the northwest base of Tumamoc Hill at the Desert Laboratory of the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona.

Site type:  The site (725 m elevation) is a gently sloped creosote flat dominated by Larrea divaricata (creosote bush), which has 50% cover. The site is located in the Arizona Upland subdivision of the Sonoran Desert.

Geography:  The study site is located at the northwest base of Tumamoc Hill 1 mile west of downtown Tucson, AZ (32'13" N, 111'01" W).

Habitat:  See "Site type" above. The quadrats extend along a transect from a flat alluvial area and up the southeast side of a gently sloping (9&#194;&#176;) hill,.

Geology: Plots are located along a gently sloping bajada (fluvial piedmont) of consistent parent material, where a strong transition occurs in the age of the soil surface with elevation. The soil on the slope is composed of basaltic andesite (Phillips 1976) with a coarse sandy-loam texture (67% sand, 20% silt, 13% clay) and with fragments ofbasaltic rocks embedded in the surface. The surrounding lower areas have recently derived alluvial soil, including sandy-clay soil at the base of the hill (54% sand, 22% silt, 24% clay) and loamy-sand soil in a series of shallow (&lt;0.5 m deep) and narrow (2-3 m wide) dry drainage channels (79% sand, 10&#194;&#176;/o silt, 10% clay). The slope is rockier (50% gravel) than the base of the hill (20% gravel) or rivulets (25% gravel) (Pantastico-Caldas and Venable 1993).

Watersheds/hydrology: N/A

Site history: The 850 acre Desert laboratory site was fences in 1906 to protect it from cattle grazing and it has been an ecological preserve subsequently.

Climate: The site receives ~300 mm of annual precipitation on average, about half of which falls during the summer monsoons (July&#226;&#128;&#147;September), with the rest occurring sporadically through the remainder of the year (Bowers and Turner 1985).</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-111.01</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-110.89899000000001</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>32.2</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>32.2</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1982</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2007</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><references>1232568812323</references></contact><contact scope="document"><references>1232568812323</references></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Data Table Overview</title><para>This data package consists of four ASCII data tables stored in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format : census data.csv (3753 KB), Seed Bank.csv (3356 KB), species list.csv (17 KB), species x year.csv (15 KB).</para><para>NOTE: These files are updated on a regular basis by the data set owner.

In 1989, 48 additional long-term study plots were established and in 1991 the total number was increased to 72, one half being located under shrubs and one half in the open. The plots have been visited following each rainfall during the germination season to check for germination. When there is more than trace germination (&gt; 1% of expected total year germination) a germination census is conducted. Following a germination census, subsequent censuses are conducted at intervals sufficiently short to recognize individual plants and distinguish survival from mortality followed by new germination (i.e., every 30-45 days). Frequently, more than one cohort per year emerges from precipitation associated with different storm systems. Each cohort is scored separately. Fecundity has been scored on a random subsample of five surviving plants from each species in each cohort in each plot at the end of the growing season. In early years 1982- 199? it was recorded for every surviving plant. Systematic annual collection of soil cores for seed bank analysis began in 1990. The cores are collected after the germination season, but prior to seed set from the following season, i.e., in February of each year.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Research Methods: Field/Laboratory</title><para>Each seedling is mapped with exact location and species identity with colored markers on acetate sheets placed with fixed coordinates over plexiglass mapping tables. The mapping tables are set over the plots in the field. At the end of the season, maps are scored to record germination and death dates, and fecundity for individual plants. This sampling and data recording scheme has been used consistently for the whole period of data collection. From this data we have calculated mean survival from germination to reproduction and mean fecundity of survivors for each cohort of each species in shrub and open habitats each year. From this we calculated the average seed set per seedling (per capita reproductive success) for each cohort of each species in the open and shrub habitats each year (proportion surviving times mean fecundity of survivors).</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Research Methods: Collection and Sampling Stategy</title><para>We collect 180 soil cores (5.4 cm diameter x 2.5 cm deep) annually using stratified random sampling (Benoit et al. 1989) along a transect connecting the 2 demographic transects for the 24- and 17-year old plots. Half of the samples are obtained from under creosote shrubs and half from open sites. The cores are collected after the germination season, but prior to seed set from the following season. Thus the viable seeds in these samples have forgone germination in at least one season. Viable seeds rarely occur below 2.5 cm in the study area. Samples are placed in paper bags to insure evaporation of any soil moisture, and if the soil is moist at the time of collection, the paper bags are opened and placed beneath fans to insure rapid drying with no further rot or germination. Seeds and organic material are separated from soil particles using a repetitive frothing, flotation, and filtering technique which has been shown to retrieve &gt;95% of seeds in blind tests. Individual soil samples are mixed with tap water and stirred vigorously. The suspension containing floating organic matter and small soil particles are then immediately decanted through an organza-cloth filter placed in a Buchner funnel attached to suction. This filter has been shown to capture all seeds of the smallest-seeded species in this guild of annual plants (Evax multicaulis, mean seed size, 0.025 mg). This process is repeated multiple times until the decanted liquid is clear. Then the organza filter and debris are placed in a labeled petri dish and oven dried for &gt;24 hrs at 40C. The organic matter with seeds is then sifted with standard testing sieves and all fractions that potentially contain seeds from the annual plant guild are spread out a spoonful at a time and examined under a dissecting microscope. All seeds are separated, counted, and identified to species by comparison to voucher seeds. The seeds are cut or poked through the seed coat to determine viability. Seeds with juicy, oily, or fleshy embryos or endosperm are scored as viable. Tetrazolium chloride testing gives inferior results due to the difficulty of manipulating our smallest seeds and because some deeply dormant viable seeds show only minimal staining. Under the field conditions from which these soil samples are collected seeds usually undergo easily recognizable changes upon death (dessication or decay of endosperm or embryo). Counting of viable seeds is superior for our system to the germination-based procedures sometimes used in other seed bank studies because viable seeds of our species often do not germinate completely (Adondakis and Venable 2004).</para></section></description><instrumentation>N/A</instrumentation></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Taxonomy and Systematics</title><para>Plant names are per Bowers and Turner (1985).</para></section></description></methodStep></methods><access authSystem="knb" order="denyFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access></dataset></ns0:eml>
