<abstract><para>Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) in Prince William Sound (PWS) have been classified as "not-recovered" by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council. Predation by marine mammals has been cited as a factor in the failure of this population to rebound. We will assess the significance of humpback whale predation on herring in PWS, particularly in winter. Specifically we will estimate the number of whales foraging in winter, determine when and if there is a prey switch to herring, and how long whales focus on herring as prey. Year one was funded, small in scale with an intense monitoring strategy; year 2 would expand the scale up in area significantly. Year 3 will verify the impact on herring of the high numbers of humpback whales we observed in PWS during year 2. These data will be combined in a bioenergetic model to determine numbers of herring consumed (and energy content consumed). Lastly, the estimated numbers of herring consumed would be included in an age-structured model so that the significance of whale predation on herring recovery can be evaluated. Year 4 (2010) will close out the project with the completion of analysis, reports, and manuscripts. This data set focuses on the humpback whale surveys including survey effort, whale identification, photo quality, whale behavior, prey items and tissue samples.</para>

<methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Tissue Results: Explaining Allele Data</title>
<para>The allele number equals the repeats in microsatellite loci received from each parent found on the same location on a chromosome. This means that each whale (an offspring of two parents) will have two allele numbers.</para>
<para>Alleles are alternative forms of a gene found at the same place on a chromosome. They are usually coded with numerical values so the two alleles (one from each parent) for one locus might be 124 and 126. These numbers represent the number of repeats in microsatellite loci. So, one allele has 124 repeats (e.g. ATATATATAT...) and the other has 126 repeats. This information is useful for determining kinship between whales.</para>

<para>These procedures are based on the biopsy protocol developed by the SPLASH Project (Structure of Populations, Levels of Abundance, and Status of Humpbacks) for collecting, handling and preserving all tissue samples, as well as to the handling and decontamination of biopsy tips and any equipment, extraction tools, etc that might come into contact with the samples.</para>
<para>1)	Prepare tip for deployment: (may be best to prepare at least 3 sets of arrows and tips at beginning of survey day to be ready for rapid multiple sampling if needed)</para>
<para>a.	Inspect arrow, float and threaded bolt for dirt or flecks of skin, swish in water to clean, use alcohol to sanitize if necessary.</para>
<para>b.	Open ziplock containing clean tip wrapped in foil.</para>
<para>c.	While keeping tip inside foil, expose threaded portion thru opening of bag and thread onto arrow shaft (so as to minimize possibility of touching/contaminating tip).</para>
<para>d.	Keep foil over tip and float of arrow until ready to use to prevent contamination.</para>
<para>e.	When approaching animal for biopsy attempt, remove foil and place in pocket or other convenient location to reuse again if possible (or use another piece of precut foil) when sample is retrieved.</para>

<para>Procedural and Scientific Methods EVOS-LTM Whales</para>
<para>Population estimates of humpback whales through the use of photographic mark- recapture models.</para>
<para>We will use Nikon D-300, D-200, and D-700 cameras with 80-200 mm lenses to capture digital images of the ventral side of humpback whale flukes to identify individuals. All photographs were ranked as good, fair, poor, and insufficient quality. Photographs deemed poor or of insufficient quality were excluded from the mark-recapture analysis to avoid potential bias from matching errors. Further, photographs of humpback whale calves were also excluded, this is because the capture probability for a calf is complicated by their co-occurrence with their mothers (and is therefore not independent), and the probability of recapture in later years can be difficult as calf flukes tend to change more than adult flukes.</para>
<para>Time series of humpback whale abundance will be constructed using mark-recapture methods. The first photograph of a particular whale is treated as the mark, and subsequent photographs of the same whale are recaptures. Both closed and open population models will be examined.</para>
<para>Monitor the seasonal trends of humpback whales in Prince William Sound relative to prey.</para>
<para>Although mark-recapture models provide an estimate of abundance, they do not describe seasonal trends. Consequently, we used the number of unique whales seen each month for establishing seasonal patterns and adjusted the pattern to account for the estimated number of whales present. The data used to establish the attendance patterns include calves and individuals identifiable in poor quality photographs and represent a lower bound to the daily attendance pattern for whales. Daily attendance was estimated by fitting linear models to the observed numbers.</para>
<para>Estimate inter-annual trends in humpback whale abundance.</para>
<para>Long term trends in abundance will be estimated by combining observations from this study and population estimates from Restoration Project: 100804, allowing us to explore the relationship between climate, prey availability, herring populations and humpback whales.</para>
<para>Determine the diet and dietary shifts of humpback whales.</para>
<para>When groups of whales are located and determined to be feeding, effort will made to determine what the whales were eating. Direct observations of prey being consumed, remains after feeding, and sonar mapping of the prey fields observed on a dual 50/200kHz frequency echosounder will be used to determine target prey of humpback whales. Prey distinctly visible on 50kHz was presumed to be fish. Prey visible only at 200kHz were presumed to be smaller and categorized as zooplankton.  Confirmation of target prey will be accomplished using herring jigs, zooplankton tows, cast nets and skim nets (used to clean swimming pools) to collect surface fish near feeding whales. Scales and zooplankton were collected behind whales feeding at the surface with the skim net. Fecal samples are collected when possible. Certainty of identification of the target prey will be recorded as certain, probable or undetermined. Only cases were the identification was certain or probable were used to identify specific prey.</para>
<para>Estimate predation rates on herring by humpback whales.</para>
<para>The large size humpback whales prevent direct measurement of ingestion rates, therefore estimates of consumption are derived from the allometry between whale size and metabolic requirements. The model combines estimates of whale size, metabolic rates, abundance, and diet with estimates of the energy content of overwintering herring to predict consumption. We will estimated the potential biomass removed for each location and winter using four different modeling scenarios because of the uncertainty in whale metabolic costs and the numbers of whale present. The different scenarios represent the range of possible estimates. Dividing the total biomass consumed under a given scenario with estimates of herring abundance yields a measure of the intensity of humpback whale predation. This ratio, referred to here as predation intensity, is not meant to indicate the actual proportion of the biomass consumed by whales, but rather as an indicator of the scale of whale predation winter under each of the modeling scenarios.</para>
<para>Incorporate mortality rates into herring age structure models.</para>
<para>Information on whale abundance will then be fed into an age-structured model for Pacific herring in order to compare the relative magnitudes of disease, whales, and other factors on the mortality of herring. This will help EVOS TC better understand what factors are preventing the recovery of herring.</para>
<para>SAMPLING PROTOCOL for EVOS-LTM Whales (Protocols &amp; Data Sheet Instructions)</para>
<para>These procedures are based on the protocol developed by the SPLASH Project (Structure of Populations, Levels of Abundance, and Status of Humpbacks</para>
<para>Abbreviations used throughout document:</para>
<para>RG = Research Group code.  The code is a 4 digit abbreviation used by each Research Group for file naming and tissue sample labeling</para>

<para>SANDLANCE=SA</para>
<para>PHALAROPE=PH</para>
<para>QUEST= QU</para>
<para>YR = Seasonal Year (when stands alone w/ out month &amp; day). Season is defined as encompassing all dates within an annual survey year.</para>
<para>YRMODY = Date in the format of: 2 or 4digit year, followed by 2-digit month, followed by 2-digit day.  This format is used for easier chronological sorting of filenames.</para>
<para>PHT = Photographer's initials, always three letters xxx - consecutively sequential number, used for photo image naming, sample labeling etc.  The number of digits required is indicated by the number of 'x' symbols.  Always use zeros (0) as space holders to produce the correct number.</para>
<para>E.g.: xxx = 001 not 1</para>
<para>Special attention should be paid to minimizing errors in the field, proofing data at the end of each day, and entering as soon as practical so that any common mistakes or misinterpreted data instructions can be caught and remedied quickly.</para>
<para>Five sets of datasheets are currently being used:</para>
<para>1)  Effort Data Form</para>
<para>2)  Pod Summary Data Form</para>
<para>3)  Tissue Sampling Form and</para>
<para>4)  Photo ID Data Form</para>
<para>5)  Prey Sampling Form.</para>
<para>Each form is described below with detailed instructions for each field.</para>
<para>Filling Out Data Forms:</para>
<para>To maximize clarity, interpretation and legibility, please number fours as an open-4, not 4 to avoid confusion with 9; and use crossed sevens as such:  7.</para>
<para>Effort Form</para>
<para>Track Data:</para>
<para>GPS should be set to record in decimal degrees (5 places, e.g. ddd.ddddd) and make certain the datum is WGS 84.</para>
<para>A vessel track log should be maintained for each survey by manually recording time and GPS position every hour on the Effort Data Form.</para>
<para>Additionally, if you have the ability to regularly download track data from your GPS to a computer, you should set the GPS to record track information in 5 minute intervals or less.  Automatically recorded track data should be downloaded from GPS.  You can fill up your GPS and download every week or so but if you think you might lose or damage your GPS you might want to do it earlier (perhaps each night). Remember to set your GPS track menu to the 'Wrap' setting so that you do not risk the GPS ceasing to store track information if memory becomes filled.  (The 'Wrap' setting continues to record track data when memory is full by overwriting the oldest information, which, hopefully, is already downloaded!!!)  Once data is downloaded using DNR Garmin (folder under My Documents/Garmin trackline), verify that file transferred successfully, and then clear the track memory on the GPS.</para>
<para>Filenames for the GPS downloaded track files should have a convention that specifies the Research Group and date or span of dates. If there is more than one vessel per RG add two letter vessel code (VS) after RG.  A suggested format would be: RG-VS-YRMODY (OR DY- DY, for a span of days).   Place track data for each month in a separate folder.</para>
<para>Regardless of the ability to download track data, it is recommended to continue manually recording the time and GPS position every  hour as described above as a backup in case of GPS failure.</para>
<para>Always remember to carry extra batteries on board for your GPS; without it your survey day is over!  Caution: with some older GPS models, putting the batteries in the wrong way or accidentally pressing the wrong button with batteries removed could cause loss of stored data files and waypoints!</para>
<para>On/Off Effort:</para>
<para>As the amount of effort for this project will be analyzed, it is important to remain diligent in noting times when crew is not actively pursuing the objectives, such as taking breaks, dealing with mechanical trouble, bad/unworkable weather or simply when done for the day and heading back to harbor or larger vessel (living platform) with no intention of working more encounters.  These times should be recorded on the effort form as going 'Off Effort'.  Likewise, after breaks, etc when vessel crew is ready to return their focus towards the projects objectives, record the vessel as returning to 'On Effort' status.  If you are on a larger vessel and using a smaller boat to collect photos and biopsies use the same hand held GPS on both vessels.</para>
<para>Effort Data Collection</para>
<para>Effort Data can be collected on the form, Effort Data, used to collect basic effort data only (weather, start and end times and positions, on and off effort, etc).</para>
<para>Region and Area:  Write in the regional name and the general area where survey is taking place.  (e.g.: PWS/Port Gravina).</para>
<para>Research Group:  Write in the name or 4 letter code for of the research group responsible conducting this survey.  (e.g. University of Alaska Southeast or UASE)</para>
<para>Vessel:  Write the name of the vessel or 2 letter code from which data is being collected.  If two vessels are used during one day (e.g. a boat used as the living platform then the skiff is used to collect photographs and biopsies) note both platforms on the form but remember only one will be entered into the database for that day; select the vessel in which the majority of the data were collected for that day by drawing a circle around the vessel code.  This will be the entry into the database.</para>
<para>Date:  YR/MO/DY (numeric).</para>
<para>Purpose:  Circle or note the purpose of the cruise.  EVOSLTM = Dedicated EVOSLTM survey, OPP = data collected opportunistically while on the water for another purpose.</para>
<para>Nautical Miles:  Note nautical miles covered on survey.  Circle this from the GPS trip log or estimated from a nautical chart.  If GPS is used be certain to clear the entry at the end of each survey day (after writing down the miles covered that day).  If using a larger vessel for a living/survey platform and then launching a smaller skiff for collecting photographs and biopsies keep a trip log for the larger vessel and the skiff with the same GPS.  You will use a lot of batteries (we are using rechargeable that are working great) but it will be easier in the long run.</para>
<para>Page ___ of ___:  Fill out the first blank with consecutive numbers for each page of an Effort Data Form recorded for that day.  The second blank should be filled out after all data for that day has been recorded and represents the total number of pages of Effort Data for a single boat for a single day.</para>
<para>Crew:  List initials of the boat driver and all regular personnel respective of their primary responsibilities.  If non-regular crews come out, record their full names.  Be consistent with initials for the same person so the data entry is easier (e.g. if someone has a nickname that starts with a different letter than the given full name, choose one set of initials for use on ALL the data forms).</para>
<para>GPS Track:  Circle Y or N if you are recording the track line with the GPS.</para>
<para>GPS Datum:  This should be preset to WGS-84</para>
<para>Units:  Circle which units you are using to record swell height, visibility distance etc.</para>
<para>Time:  Record time in 24 hr format, (hhmm; e.g. 0800)</para>
<para>Latitude:  Record latitude from GPS in decimal degrees (dd.ddddd).  Record every hour.</para>
<para>Longitude:  Read longitude from GPS in decimal degrees (ddd.ddddd).  Record every hour.</para>
<para>Keep a diligent eye on changes in sea state and weather conditions so changes can be appropriately recorded as necessary.   You will be able to record multiple scales for the same day in the database by separating the numbers with a comma.</para>
<para>Bft:  Record sea state using the Beaufort scale as follows:</para>
<para>Beaufort 0 = seas like a mirror.</para>
<para>Beaufort 1 = wave height to 3 inches, seas rippled with appearance of scales, no foam crests.</para>
<para>Beaufort 2 = wave height 6 inches to -1 foot, small wavelets, crests of glassy appearance, not breaking.</para>
<para>Beaufort 3 = wave height 2-3 feet, large wavelets, crests begin to break, scattered whitecaps (winds 7-10 knots).</para>
<para>Beaufort 4 = wave height 3.5-5 feet, small waves becoming longer, numerous whitecaps (winds 11-16 knots).</para>
<para>Beaufort 5 = wave height 6-9 feet, moderate waves, many whitecaps (winds 17-22 knots)</para>
<para>Beaufort 6+= sea spray, etc.  You should already be on land entering data, because there is really no point in trying to collect more!</para>
<para>Swell (m/ft):  Estimate the height of the sea swell (meters or feet), circle the appropriate units in the column header.</para>
<para>Vis. (km/nm):  Visibility, distance to farthest observed land masses or horizon (km or nm), circle the appropriate units in the column header.</para>
<para>Stg Cond (E/G/F/P):  Sighting Conditions - Subjective description of overall sighting and visibility conditions (including experience of crew), expressed as: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor.</para>
<para>General Weather:  General weather description such as: SUNNY, OVERCAST, PARTLY CLOUDY, RAIN.  You can circle more than one weather description (e.g. overcast and rain)</para>
<para>Notes:  In this column record any useful notes or information specific to particular events such as On Effort or Off Effort.  If you are located off a headland when you note a lat/long, note that headland or location (e.g.  offshore, Red Head)</para>
<para>The start of survey day is assumed to be the start of being On Effort, unless otherwise noted. This can be when you leave the harbor.</para>
<para>Go Off  Effort.  This should be recorded for breaks, lunch, mechanical problems, poor weather, heading home at end of survey day with no intention of further work with whales, or in the case of encounters of any duration with cetaceans other than humpbacks.  i.e.:  Whenever time is spent towards anything other than the project objectives over 5 minutes, you should go Off Effort.</para>
<para>Record changes in conditions when they occur!!!!!</para>
<para>Pod Summary Form Instructions:</para>
<para>This form is used to collect sighting data such as time, location, water depth, temperature, group composition and behavior for all encounters, as well as a summary of samples collected from each group.  All sightings for a particular survey day will be listed on this form.  Although we specifically focus on humpbacks, it would be useful to note time, location, species and approximate group size of any other cetaceans encountered and photographed.  For more information regarding encounters with other species, see Opportunistic Encounters with Other Cetaceans below.</para>
<para>Research Group:  Circle the research group code responsible for conducting the survey.</para>
<para>Region and area:  Regional name should be on the form.  Indicate the general area where survey is taking place. (e.g. PWS)</para>
<para>Vessel: Write the name of the vessel(s) or 2 letter code(s) from which data is being collected.  Circle the vessel, if more than two used on one day, where most of the data were collected.</para>
<para>Date: YR/MO/DY (numeric).</para>
<para>Units/Source:  Circle the appropriate units and source used for measuring depth and temperature, if recorded.  Some vessels may not have this capacity. Circle the appropriate units in the column header (meters/ feet/ fathoms).  Circle either DpthSndr or NavChrt to note the source of the depth data.</para>
<para>Circle if GPS transducer 'GPS' or hand held thermometer 'Therm' recorded temperature.</para>
<para>Sighting Data:</para>
<para>Pod #:  Sequential # reset daily that uniquely distinguishes each whale group encounter for that day.   A brand new Pod # is issued the group composition changes; use this if you are at all uncertain if whales have joined a previously observed group.  Use the same pod number if the group composition stays the same.</para>
<para>Start/End Time:  Record time at the start of a new encounter or whenever a Pod # is modified.    Format = 24hr (hhmm).</para>
<para>Start/End Position Lat/Long:  Record the latitude and longitude from GPS at the start of new encounter and the end of encounter position.</para>
<para>Group Type:  Describe group composition.  This can be, either a mother/calf group (M/C); mother without calf (L for Lone), she had to be seen earlier in the season with a calf (used a lot in the fall when calves are separating from their mothers); adult (A); or juvenile (J) if ONLY known from first sighting as a calf.  Do not use J if you do not know the age; if the whale seems smaller and possibly a juvenile note this in comments and use U.  Use U, for unknown, if the group type can not be determined.</para>
<para>Group Size:  Best/Min/Max = Best estimate of number in group/Minimum number of animals of one species in a group/ Maximum number of individuals in a group.  This information should be determined by consulting all individuals (e.g., if one individual saw only 8 in the group, yet another positively saw 12 at one time, the maximum number should be 12, not 8.)</para>
<para>Start Depth/Temp:  Record water depth and temperature where group is first sighted, if possible.</para>
<para>Photos:  Note the start and end frame numbers for each pod encounter. The end frame should be a blank (photograph of land or object).  Do not delete any images, including blanks or poor quality images.  These are important as spacers in the data.  Include the blank photos either at the end or beginning of a new encounter.  Write BL below the frame number to denote blank.</para>
<para># Flukes (FL) and Genetic samples (G):  Summary of the total number of whales photographed and tissue samples, either biopsy or sloughed skin, successfully collected during the encounter.</para>
<para>Activity:  Record the overall behavior of group during encounter (e.g., travel, feed, resting, etc.)</para>
<para>End Code: Record the reason for leaving a group:</para>
<para>P = Protocol: Choose to leave a group because:</para>
<para>1)  all whales have been photo-Id, OR</para>
<para>2)  the encounter has lasted at least 30 minutes or</para>
<para>3)  the group has gone through a minimum of at least 3 dive sequences, whichever occurs first.  You can spend longer with a group.</para>
<para>O = Opportunistic encounter:  such as humpbacks photographed/sampled in a passing group while "officially" working with a different group.  This could also include sightings of other cetaceans while focus is on another encounter.</para>
<para>L = Lost:  group is lost and not resighted due to group's behavior (change direction, long dive, etc.) or if group is left inadvertently due to confusion with other groups in the area</para>
<para>A = Abandoned:  leave a group for reason unrelated to group behavior, such as weather, mechanical trouble, presence of other boats, etc.</para>
<para>T=  Take by harassment, changed whale behavior; not necessary to end encounter but needs to be recorded for permit reporting.</para>
<para>AF=Affil; whales join or leave group, so go to new sighting # for new group</para>
<para>Notes:  In this column record any useful notes, or information specific to particular encounters.  Record here if there was an encounter, but no biopsy was attempted, or no photos were taken.  You could mention if all whales were dorsal fin only photographs (DFO) and the whales were not showing flukes.</para>
<para>Photo-ID Data Form Instructions:</para>
<para>If multiple cameras are used on any particular encounter, use a separate Photo-ID Data form for each camera.</para>
<para>Blanks (picture of something other than a whale) should be taken at the end of each encounter, and after successful biopsies if photographs were obtained of the biopsied individual or whenever it could be useful to clearly distinguish between photographic events.  Do not take blanks of the water, this can be interpreted as a missed photo, rather than as a blank.</para>
<para>A different Photo-ID Data form can be used for each group (especially if a large group or shoal) OR if the group sizes are small, multiple pods can be recorded on the same form. In the case of photo collection of Opportunistic Groups while officially working with another group, the opportunistic photo data can be recorded on the same form as long as it is noted that these images belong to a different group of whales by giving them another pod number.   This keeps the frames numbers in consecutive order.  Do not delete images unless absolutely necessary (running out of card space would be the only reason).</para>
<para>Date: YR/MO/DY (numeric).</para>
<para>Pod #:  Note number of pod encountered or the range of pods on one data form.</para>
<para>Page ___ of ___:  Fill out the first blank with consecutive numbers each time photo data is recorded on a new page for the survey day.  The second blank should be filled out after all data for the day has been recorded and represents the total number of pages of photo data for that encounter.</para>
<para>Driver etc.:  Note driver, photographer, note taker and biopsy person if different than the driver. Note at the frame number row if anything changes.  If there are multiple people doing the same position throughout the day (say the drivers switched during the day), note everyone and circle the initials of the person who spent the majority of time in that position.</para>
<para>Camera:  Model# or Camera number/designation and flash card number.  Circle or write in the appropriate model number.  If multiple cameras used on any particular encounter, use a separate Photo-ID Data form for each camera.</para>
<para>Start Frame:  First camera frame number recorded on this sheet(s) for this day.</para>
<para>End Frame:  Last camera frame number recorded on this sheet(s) for this day.</para>
<para>Frame #:  List each individual frame number shot during encounter.  If an unbroken sequence of shots is taken of same feature on same whale, then can combine frames on same line, e.g.: Frames 012 to 014, Flukes of Whale# A.  Don't delete any photos if you can help it (the only reason would be if you have one card and are running out of space, otherwise keep everything). If possible (this will make the data entry much easier), place an arrow (or some other notation) next to the frame number of the best photo of each feature for each whale seen each day.</para>
<para>Pod #:  Note the pod number for this group.  This can be done once on the first line of data for a series of whales within a pod if photographed consecutively.  If an opportunistic pod is photographed in the midst of photographing the target pod resume noting the initial pod number when finished with the opportunistic pod.</para>
<para># of whales:  Record the number (or range, if uncertain) of whales in this pod (this will be duplicative of the pod summary form).  This helps in figuring out how many flukes were obtained from each pod.</para>
<para>Whale:  Letter designation assigned to each whale in a particular sighting group to help keep track of individuals during the encounter.  The number written here indicates the whale photographed.  If not absolutely certain about which whale was photographed, record the letter inside parenthesis to indicate uncertainty.  Also, if photos are taken of an opportunistic group while working another group, continue recording photos of both groups on same Photo-ID form by indicating another Pod number and letter designation of opportunistic group in this column as well.  Opportunistic whales are whales that pass by while you are working with another group.</para>
<para>Feature:  Code indicating which portion of animal was the intended focus or purpose of each photographic image:</para>
<para>FL	= ventral side of whale Fluke</para>
<para>LD	= Left side of animalls Dorsal fin and/or flank</para>
<para>RD	= Right side of animalls Dorsal fin and/or flank</para>
<para>LT	= Left side of animal's tailstock</para>
<para>RT	= Right side of animal's tailstock</para>
<para>DT	= Dorsal view animal&#8217;s tailstock</para>
<para>SC	= Scar: image focusing on a particular scar, describe location &amp; details in</para>
<para>Notes field.</para>
<para>GE	= Gender: ventral view taken specifically to identify sex of animal</para>
<para>OT	= Other such as head, lunge, other species etc.</para>
<para>BY	= Biopsy: any photo (Fluke, Dorsal fin or other) taken at time of Biopsy to</para>
<para>identify animal sampled.  Record Sample # in notes.</para>
<para>BL	= Blank: photo taken to clearly separate events in the photo record,</para>
<para>particularly after successful Biopsy shot or at end of encounter.  Briefly note subject of blank in Notes field.</para>
<para>Role:  The role that a particular individual plays in the group.  If uncertain place letter in parentheses:</para>
<para>A	=Adult, presumed by size and/or behavior</para>
<para>M	= mother with calf of the year.</para>
<para>C	= calf of the year.</para>
<para>L	=lone mother, previously seen with a calf but not present in this encounter</para>
<para>J	=known age whale less than 5 years, only denote this role is certain of age</para>
<para>U	= unknown behavioral role.</para>
<para>Notes:  Record additional notes for each frame, description of Scar image, one-word description of blanks, position description when multiple whales occur in same image (rear, front, etc.),</para>
<para>For each fluke diagram box:</para>
<para>Whale #:  Note the pod and letter number of this individual (e.g. 1A, 1B, etc.)</para>
<para>Fluke diagram:  Circle the degree of pigmentation on ventral side of the flukes, numbers between 1 and 5, where 1 = all white, 5 = all black and/or sketch the fluke coloration. If the whale did not show flukes note NO FL across the diagram.</para>
<para>Pecs: Next to the word PECS, circle the color of the pectoral fins (if visible) as B=black or W=white.</para>
<para>Dorsal Fin diagram:  If you wish, sketch in shape of dorsal fin if distinctive and location of biopsy hit, if collected.</para>
<para>Genetics:  Circle Y or N if any biopsies or sloughed skin collected from this whale.</para>
<para>Prey or feces: Circle Y or N if any prey or feces collected (or note even if seen visually) and note what kind (species of fish or euphausiids) in the diagram, if there is room, or in the notes for that whale.</para>
<para>Proofing Data:</para>
<para>At the end of the day, data recorders should go through each data sheet to ensure all fields have been marked appropriately.  Or fill out data forms if data were collected in a field notebook during the day.  It is also recommended to have a second person look over the sheets, as it is often easier to spot errors or missing information when you haven't recorded the information yourself.  Data should be reviewed the same evening as collected, or ASAP afterwards, as it is much easier to recall events that might have been missed in the data while the memory is still fresh.</para>
<para>Double-check all data fields.  If a blank field is found and the recorder is not certain of the data, consult with the appropriate person.  If a particular datasheet was not recorded for an encounter (i.e. no photos taken, or no sampling attempted) note such in the comments for that encounter.  Ensure the proper date, page number and other header information is recorded for that day's data sheets.  Once all data has been proofed and all fields have data, the data can be entered into Access database.</para>
<para>Data Entry</para>
<para>Enter data into the Access database.  Protocol is provided in another file.  If you do not have the database protocol the file structure and naming procedure is as follows:</para>
<para>C: \EVOSLTM</para>
<para>\DATABASE</para>
<para>\Digital_Images</para>
<para>\RGRP   (research group code)</para>
<para>\2012</para>
<para>\2012MONTHDY (use the word for month, not number, here)</para>
<para>\originals</para>
<para>The 2012MONTHDY folder contains all image files for a specific day.  Place the RAW (NEF) images or untouchable originals in the originals folder.  Files should be named in Nikon View/Nikon Transfer (under Tools) in this manner (under change):</para>
<para>RGRP-INITIALS OF PHOTOGRAPHER-4DIGITYEAR2DIGITMONTH2DIGITDAY-CARDNUMBER-THREEDIGITFRAMENUMBER (example GBNP-CMG-20030725-1-076.nef).</para>
<para>Convert the NEF files to JPG using Nikon View and place them in the 2004MONTHDYfolder along with the original folder using the same exact file name used for the RAW images.  The JPG settings to select under (Copy and Resize as JPGS) are:  Large under Image Size and Large/High under Quality Settings.  The Destination Folder is the 2004MONTHDY folder.  Do not place these jpg images in the originals folder.  Remember to look at the file rename check option in the Destination Folder area and make certain this is unchecked.  Otherwise the image name will be changed and we DO NOT want this to happen.  The image names need to remain exactly the same for the original RAW image as the JPG image.  This is VERY important otherwise the files will not be linked in the database because the database links to the JPGs not the original RAW files.</para>
<para>If something seems awkward or could be refined for easier data gathering or entry, please note and let Jan or Jen know what improvements could be made to the data forms or database.   We are working on making the data forms to better fit the data entry protocol.  Right now it is awkward to enter data from the forms.</para>
<para>Data Backup:</para>
<para>Backup copies of all digital data should be made frequently.  In fact, it is strongly encouraged that the original RAW (NEF) digital photos and GPS track line data be downloaded to computer nightly. Save theses data on the computer and an external hard drive or CD prior to reformatting the CF card.</para>
<para>Hardcopy of Data Forms:  Make a copy of all datasheets frequently.  Keep the originals for your own use and submit the copied set to the regional data manager.</para>
<para>Opportunistic Encounters with Other Cetaceans:</para>
<para>When other species of cetaceans are encountered, please record them and collect basic information (location, group size, species ID, and opportunistic photos) from all sightings.  These, in general, should be brief (except for killer whales) and not detour you from your efforts.  If an encounter is of particular interest (unusual species, etc) and you spend more than 5 minutes with this encounter, you should record 'OFF EFFORT' on the effort form to indicate that you are no longer focusing on project objectives.  Likewise, once you return to sampling, be sure to note going back 'ON EFFORT.'   Go off effort for killer whales.</para>

The allele number equals the repeats in microsatellite loci received from each parent found on the same location on a chromosome. This means that each whale (an offspring of two parents) will have two allele numbers.

Alleles are alternative forms of a gene found at the same place on a chromosome. They are usually coded with numerical values so the two alleles (one from each parent) for one locus might be 124 and 126. These numbers represent the number of repeats in microsatellite loci. So, one allele has 124 repeats (e.g. ATATATATAT&#8230;) and the other has 126 repeats. This information is useful for determining kinship between whales.</attributeDefinition>

The allele number equals the repeats in microsatellite loci received from each parent found on the same location on a chromosome. This means that each whale (an offspring of two parents) will have two allele numbers.

Alleles are alternative forms of a gene found at the same place on a chromosome. They are usually coded with numerical values so the two alleles (one from each parent) for one locus might be 124 and 126. These numbers represent the number of repeats in microsatellite loci. So, one allele has 124 repeats (e.g. ATATATATAT&#8230;) and the other has 126 repeats. This information is useful for determining kinship between whales.</attributeDefinition>
