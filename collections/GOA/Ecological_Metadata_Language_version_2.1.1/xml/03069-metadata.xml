 <abstract> <para>This dataset contains the short-term survival and tag loss data from tagging of juvenile pink salmon with passive integrated transpondar (PIT) tags in southwestern Prince William Sound, Alaska. The catch data is referenced by date, time of day, latitude and longitude. This was a feasibility study and contains catch data from 1 purse seine set on 1 day.  This is the only test of the mortality of juvenile pink salmon captured in the marine environment and tagged with PIT tags documented in the primary or gray literature as of 2005. The goal of this project was to evaluate the use of PIT tags as a second mark on otolith thermal marked juvenile hatchery pink salmon. The mortality could then be evaluated separately for early marine and the open ocean phases of the pink salmon life cycle.  Also included are water temperature and slainity data for the water in which the juvenile pink salmon were held during the short term mortality test. Data on tag detection in a adult pink salmon in a processing plant and detector configurations are also included. The fish were captured on 7/6/2005 at 17:51 GMT and tagging was complete by 01:59 on 7/7/2005 GMT. The fish were held on board the ADFG vessel R/V Solstice in an insulated fish tote until the study ended after 96 hours (7/11/2005 @ 02:00 GMT).

Survival to 96 hours was 92.5% (185 of 200), but 2 more fish had injuries that would have caused mortality. A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities. Detection tests in August 2005 at one processing plant in Cordova supported that assessment.  Detection probabilities from three tests (n=51 tagged fish) were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.06.  Changes to processing lines to reduce the amount of metal would be required to get acceptable detection rates.  

The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council provided most of the funding for this project. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game contrbuted a significant amount of vessel time and PIT tag readers and data loggers (Mark Williette in the Soldotna office). The United States Forest Service (Dirk Lang) also loaned a portable PIT tag reader.</para>

 <methods> <methodStep> <description> <section> <title>Objective 1: Estimate PIT tag loss and handling mortality</title>
 <para>To estimate PIT tag loss and tagging-induced mortality, the ADF&amp;G research vessel R/V Solstice was used to capture juvenile salmon just inside Shelter Bay, Evans Island on 5 and 6 July 2005. An anchovy purse seine net (25 m deep with 1.5 cm stretch mesh) was deployed to capture fish, and the net was held open for 20 minutes each set. The total number of fish captured for each set were counted or estimated by species and life stage (juvenile or adult).</para>
 <para>The first set, 5 July 2005, was used to test our capture and handling of juvenile salmon and practice implanting PIT tags. The seine was pursed and the net reduced in size until fish could be collected with a long-handled (~2 m), small mesh dip net. The web near the boat was kept about 2-3 m deep to allow jelly fish (Scyphozoa) to sink below the fish. Juvenile salmon were dip netted into 2 large coolers (121 liters) and 3 totes (68 liters) filled with salt water from the vessel's saltwater wash pump. Salt water was pumped into two of the coolers and water was allowed to overflow. The totes were filled with salt water and refreshed about every 15-30 minutes. Each container also had a battery powered air stone (aerator) that ran continuously.</para>
 <para>The juvenile pink salmon were separated into a tote until 20 fish were available. The remaining fish were kept in the two coolers with circulating sea water and air stones and monitored for signs of stress. Two to four juvenile pink salmon at a time were placed in a tote with a MS-222 (Finquil) solution and anesthetized. In a change from the original proposal procedures, MS-222  was used rather than clove oil because it was readily available, and project personnel were experienced with using MS-222. The fish were PIT tagged using procedures outlined by Prentice et al. (1990b) and allowed to recover in a tote of sea water. After testing the anesthesia and tagging process with 20 juvenile pink salmon, all tagged fish were exposed to a lethal level of MS-222 and dissected to examine tag placement. All remaining live fish were released close to the capture site.</para>
 <para>A second purse seine set on the morning of 6 July 2005 captured all the fish required for PIT tagging (n = 200 juvenile pink salmon). Juvenile salmon were dip netted into the coolers and most of the juvenile chum salmon O. keta were separated and released. All tagging was completed with a 2 person crew. Four to five juvenile pink salmon at a time were anesthetized in</para>
 <para>a solution of MS-222, measured for snout to fork length to the nearest millimeter, and then tagged. The individually coded PIT tags (glass encased, 12 mm x 2.1mm, 125 kHz) were injected just posterior of the right pectoral fin off the ventral midline using a modified 12 gauge hypodermic needle and syringe (Prentice et al. 1990b). Needles were sterilized in isopropyl alcohol for a minimum of 10 minutes before the first use and after each use. Hypodermic needles were replaced if they became dull. An electronic PIT tag reader was used to scan each tag code into a file just prior to tagging. Additionally, the tag code, fish length, time of tagging (military time), and comments on the fish condition or tagging process were recorded on paper data forms. After tagging, fish were allowed to recover in a tote with clean sea water and then transferred to an insulated fish tote (898 liters) covered with mosquito netting or a clean cotton sheet to keep the fish from jumping out and protect them from avian predation. This study did not include a control group because our objective was to estimate the short-term mortality from tagging and handling.</para>
 <para>After all fish were tagged and transferred to the large tote, all remaining fish were released. An aerator circulation pump was used until all fish were in the large tote. The aerator circulation pump was then removed and the tote was constantly supplied with sea water from the vessel wash pump and aeration was supplied by three battery powered air stones. The amount of water</para>
 <para>supplied by the pump was adjusted to keep the fish from swimming circles in the tank. Fish were kept in the tote on the deck of the R/V Solstice for 96 hours. The tagged fish were maintained in a tote on the R/V Solstice instead of a net pen near Armin F. Koernig Hatchery as outlined in the original proposal because this allowed more control over the water parameters (temperature, salinity), food availability, and protection from predators.  Approximately every four hours the tote was examined for dead fish and the water temperature and salinity were measured and recorded. Dead fish were removed, scanned for a PIT tag and the time and tag number recorded. After tagging the fish were not feed for approximately the first 48 hours. From 48-72 hours, the fish were feed zooplankton from approximately 25 vertical tows (20 m) and 1 horizontal tow (300 m) made with a plankton net (200 micron mesh; 75 cm dia mouth opening). Commercial fish food was used for the last 24 hours.</para>
 <para>The short-term survival of tagged fish (St) was estimated from St=mL/mT, where mL is the number of live tagged fish at the end of the experiment, and mT is the total number of tagged fish at the beginning of the experiment. Tag loss (TL) was estimated from TL=nL/mT, where nL is the number of live fish without a tag at the end of the experiment. The standard error of the estimates was calculated as described by Zar (1996). Ninety-six hours after the last fish was tagged, all fish were exposed to a lethal level of MS-222 and then frozen. The fish were later thawed and checked for tag loss by scanning with an electronic tag reader. All fish were also examined for external injuries.</para>

 <methodStep> <description> <section> <title>Objective 2: Determination of optimal scanning configuration at processor plant</title>
 <para>The second objective of this project was to determine the optimal configurations of PIT tag scanning equipment at each salmon processor in PWS and estimate tag detection rates at each processor. This method of recovering PIT tagged fish was used by Willette et al. (2003) in Cook Inlet, Alaska. However, they injected PIT tags into the cheek muscle of adult salmon and were able to scan at PVC chutes just after the heading machine while our objective was to test configurations for scanning of adult salmon with the PIT tag in the body cavity.</para>
 <para>During July and early August 2005 we examined the Cordova processing plants for processing line locations without excessive metal or electric motors that would interfere with tag detection. Unlike the experience of Willette et al. (2003), there did not appear to be processing line locations that would provide good detection rates without extensive modifications. Therefore, there were several changes from our original procedures outlined for this objective. No attempt was made to conduct detection tests at plants in Valdez or Seward, and we conducted our detection tests with 51 PIT tagged fish rather than 100 fish as outlined in our original objectives because preliminary configuration testing suggested we would not get good detection rates.</para>
 <para>On 17 August 2005 we ran PIT tag detection tests at the Ocean Beauty Seafoods plant in Cordova. Tests were conducted at two locations in the plant: 1) a nonmetal conveyor belt in an aluminum frame, and 2) an aluminum belt with plastic conveyor sides. These appeared to be locations that would have the least interference from metal or electric motors. Fifty-one commercially harvested adult pink salmon were injected with PIT tags (12 mm x 2.1 mm, 134.2 kHz) in the same body cavity location described earlier for juvenile pink salmon. The fish were scanned with an electronic tag detector to ensure the tags were working, and then placed on the moving conveyor, one at a time, and transported past a handheld racket antenna and electronic tag detector. The antenna power, distance from the fish, and location of the antenna (under the conveyor belt vs. over the conveyor belt) was varied with a small number of fish to find a configuration that maximized the antenna current. Two different electronic detectors and racket antennas were tried for multiple configurations. The antenna current was lower than suggested by manufacturer for all configurations examined. Three tests with 51 tagged fish were completed and the numbers of tags detected were documented.</para>
 <para>Tag detection rate (Cd) from each test was estimated from Cd= md/mt, where md is the number of detected tags, and mt is the number of known tagged fish scanned. The standard error of the estimate was calculated as described by Zar (1996).</para>
