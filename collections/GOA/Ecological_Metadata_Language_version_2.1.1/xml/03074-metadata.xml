 <abstract><para>Routine hydraulic sampling of pink salmon eggs (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) is the subject of a long-running dispute over impacts of the Exxon Valdez oil spill on embryo survival in Prince William Sound, Alaska, because relationships between the time of spawning, sensitivity of eggs to mechanical damage, and sample timing were unclear. Previous laboratory or hatchery studies demonstrate that resistance of eggs to mechanical damage increases with maturity, but applicability to natural populations requires an understanding of embryo age distributions and the ability to discriminate between sampler-induced egg mortality and natural mortality. Resistance of naturally spawned eggs to hydraulic shock, determined six times between late September and mid-November in a southeastern Alaska stream, increased sigmoidally from less than 2% to 98%. In contrast, the number of eggs that died from natural causes was unrelated to sample time. Rapid removal of all eggs from the water allowed accurate discrimination between shocked and eggs dead prior to sampling, an improved method we recommend for future studies. The rate of shock resistance increase was slower in naturally spawned eggs than in uniform-age embryos subjected to the same hydraulic shock. We caution that combining shocked and dead eggs into one 'dead' category does not accurately describe natural mortality.

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Study area</title>
 <para>Lovers Cove Creek is located on eastern Baranof Island in southeastern Alaska. The stream has three primary channels that enter an extensive intertidal area that extends approximately 458 m (Hanavan and Skud 1954), encompasses about 3.5 ha, and flows into the head of Port Walter. About 60,000 pink salmon spawn in the intertidal portion of the stream each year. Our observations were restricted to a 100 m segment in the eastern branch of Lovers Cove Creek including a straight 83 m intertidal section with fairly uniform gradient and gravel size (Martin 1973); mean channel width was 15 m.</para>
 <para>Hourly water temperature of Lovers Cove Creek was measured with a thermograph beginning October 19, 2000. Daily Sashin Creek temperatures recorded at the Little Port Walter hatchery were regressed with Lovers Cove Creek temperatures to estimate Lovers Cove Creek temperatures prior to October 19.</para>
 <para>Adults were counted in the study section of the stream about twice a week from September 29 to October 11. Two observers positioned about 20 m from the stream counted the fish at low tide and the mean of their observations was used as the count for that day.</para>
 <para>Trip dates were as follows:</para>
 <para>Sept. 27, 1st trip</para>
 <para>Oct. 4, 2nd trip</para>
 <para>Oct. 18, 3rd trip</para>
 <para>Oct. 24, 4th trip</para>

 <para>The 100-m study section of Lovers Cove Creek was divided into 25 transects, each perpendicular to stream flow, and marked on the banks with metal stakes. Three or four randomly selected transects were sampled without replacement during one of six 2-3 d sampling periods between September 27 and November 15, 2000. For each transect sampled, a line was fastened across the stream, and gravel was excavated within 1.5 m upstream of the line with a 1-m long by 3.8 cm diameter stainless steel probe discharging a 170 L/min. air-water mixture. A cylindrical basket (0.1 m2) with a 1 mm mesh collection bag surrounded the probe. Each 0.1 m2 area was pumped for 1 minute; dislodged eggs were transferred immediately to a plastic tray. Eggs from consecutive pumpings were combined to form samples of at least 100 eggs; pumping along a transect continued until a minimum of five samples were completed. Eight to 35 pumpings per transect were necessary to obtain sufficient numbers of eggs; a total of 2415-4756 eggs were collected during each sample period. Care was taken to not walk on adjacent transects to avoid damaging incubating eggs.</para>
 <para>Eggs were sorted from the gravel and debris, removed from the water, and placed on a screen (1 mm mesh size) for classification and counting. Eggs were classified as live (pink) without visible eye pigmentation, live with pigmented eyes, dead (white), or shocked (changing from pink to white). Removal of eggs from water arrested the characteristic change in shocked eggs from pink to white that occurs as proteins coagulate, and ensured that shocked eggs were not confused with natural egg mortality. (Serendipitous observation in a concurrent experiment, Carls et al. (2004a) demonstrated that removal from water arrests color change.) After initial classification, to ensure that mildly shocked eggs were not misidentified as live eggs, remaining pink-colored eggs were gently placed in water for about 10 minutes to allow continued whitening of mildly shocked eggs. Empty chorions were not counted and were not used for egg classification because of the uncertainty of their origin.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Shock resistance in known-age eggs</title>
 <para>To compare the shock resistance of naturally spawned eggs to those of known age, gametes from Lovers Cove Creek pink salmon (3 females, 2 males) were artificially crossed, incubated in the nearby Little Port Walter hatchery, and periodically tested for shock resistance. Egg subsamples were placed in a simulated redd, a 208 L barrel filled with 80 cm of Lovers Cove Creek gravel and pumped with the same equipment and procedures used to collect naturally spawned eggs. On four days (1-28 d after fertilization), about 200 eggs were placed within a 10cm diameter by 2 cm high aluminum ring in the simulated redd. The ring was covered with eight 0.05 &#215; 2 &#215; 10 cm pieces of plastic to protect the eggs as they were covered with approximately 20-25 cm of additional gravel from Lovers Cove Creek: (20-25 cm redd depths are typical for well-populated spawning grounds; Heard 1991). Before hydraulic sampling, water was added so that the gravel surface was covered with about 20 cm of water.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Data analysis</title>
 <para>Shock resistance, percentage of eyed eggs, and percentage of naturally dead eggs with time were described by logistical regression (SAS GENMOD procedure, SAS 1999), corrected for overdispersion (Williams 1982). The times when half (or 90 %) of the embryos became resistant to shock (or became eyed) were estimated from the logistic equations and are reported as time +/- SD.</para>
