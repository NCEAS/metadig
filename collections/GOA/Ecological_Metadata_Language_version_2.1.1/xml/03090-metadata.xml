<abstract><para>Abstract: Harbor seals in Aialik Bay, a tidewater glacial habitat on the Kenai Peninsula, have been monitored since 1979 by field observations and remotely controlled video cameras. From 1980-2002 mean numbers of pups, adjusted for environmental conditions, declined 88% from 148 to 18 pups and remained stable through 2007 while seals counted during molt declined 82% from 801 seals to 141seals. Since 2002, numbers of molting seals have shown rapid growth of 21%/yr, coincident with use of expanding habitat near Pedersen Glacier. Results indicate that Aialik Bay, especially Pedersen Lake, is a favorable molt location, but low pup counts indicate continued poor recruitment. Kayak interactions and seal behavior were evaluated from 2004-2007. Results showed seals in Pedersen Lake abandoned the ice more frequently when humans were present. Although guided trips caused less impact than unguided trips, mitigation training provided to guides resulted in a further reduction in numbers of seals abandoning the ice.

Purpose: Population studies of harbor seals using glacial ice in Aialik Bay were first conducted from 1979-1981 (Hoover 1983) and were continued intermittently through 1995 (NPS unpublished, Hoover-Miller unpublished). Beginning in 2002, the National Park Service's Ocean Alaska Science and Learning Center supported the development and use of remotely controlled video cameras to document information on numbers of seals at haulouts and haulout attendance relative to local environmental conditions, glacier activity and interactions between humans and seals since 2002.

Description of data: Two primary data sets are produced by the video monitoring project: one includes count, environmental co-variates, video camera performance, and general video tape log, and the other includes video observations pertaining to vessel interactions with harbor seals. Format: Primary data associated with video monitoring have been incorporated into two Access databases. Original video images are stored on VHS video tape; a digital conversion of a subset of records is planned for 2008. Paper records of counts, vessel Other data sets pertainin to weather, lunar cycles, tidal cycles and related environmental data have been compiled from other sources for analysis.

<para>Baseline field studies were conducted in upper Aialik Bay from 17 May-17 August, 1979, 15 May-23 August 1980, and 21 May-12 June 1981 (Hoover 1983). Censuses of marine mammals were conducted at the head of Aialik Bay from the northern end of Squab Island by observers using 7X35 binoculars and, in most years, a 15-45X spotting scope. For each census the date, time, tide, weather (percent cloud cover, wind direction, wind velocity, precipitation) ice density and direction of ice movement were recorded. The location of ice and seals were mapped. Multiple censuses were conducted daily (n=125 in 1979; 130 in 1980, and 36 in 1981). Counts during periods of fog, heavy rain, and wind speeds exceeding 10 m/s (20 kn) were not always completed because of poor visibility and reduced numbers of seals. During each census, total numbers of all marine mammals observed on the ice and in the water were recorded.</para>

<para>Remotely controlled video monitoring equipment developed and maintained by SeeMore Wildlife Inc. and operated at the Alaska SeaLife Center in Seward, Alaska, were installed in June 2002 to observe harbor seals in Aialik Bay. Cameras were installed on Squab Island, at the head of Aialik Bay, and on the south side of Pedersen Lake, near Pedersen Glacier (Figure 3). The equipment included visible light, commercially available block video cameras with 25X optical and up to 300X digital zoom. The cameras were mounted in weatherproof housings that included remote-controlled pan, tilt, zoom and windshield wiper/washer assemblies. Cameras were controlled via computers located at the Alaska SeaLife Center. User-selected control signals were transmitted more than 90 km to the desired camera via UHF frequencies and video signals were transmitted along the reciprocal path to the ASLC via a series of microwave repeaters (Figure 3). Observers immediately recorded data from live images. Time-lapse recordings were concurrently taken to provide a record of environmental conditions, seal distribution, interactions between humans and seals, and, when viewing opportunities were favorable, the behavior of seals. In 2003, the system expanded to include a camera site on the north side of Aialik Glacier to observe the glacier-face environment, and in 2005 a site was installed south  of Pedersen Glacier.   During 2002, censuses were conducted methodically scanning the ice during mid-day (11:30-13:30) and at other times as opportunity allowed. In 2003-2004 censuses were conducted at approximately 09:00, 11:30, 13:00, 15:00 and 17:00.  From 4-6 June, 11-14 June and 1-8 August (2004 - 2007), censuses were conducted at  approximately 07:00, 08:00, 09:00, 10:00, 11:30, 13:00, 15:00, 17:00, and 19:00 for more frequent monitoring during times of maximum expected attendance of pupping and molting seals.   Typically, each census was initiated with the Squab Island camera. An ice scan using eleven predefined positions captured a panorama of images covering a 360 degree view to show the ice distribution and general survey conditions (cloud cover, precipitation, and sea state). The ice was then methodically scanned.  Seals present on ice were immediately recorded on data forms with the date and time.  Swimming seals were distinguished from seals on ice and were not included in the count.  Weather conditions including percent cloud cover, wind direction, wind velocity (based on a modified Beaufort scale reflecting the reduced fetch of the upper bay), precipitation, composite weather (1= full sun, 2=partial clouds to overcast, 3=precipitation and wind 20kn), and general direction of ice movement were recorded. From 2004-2007, temperature, barometric pressure, windspeed, wind direction and humidity were measured by a weather station located on Squab Island and recorded for each survey.</para>

<methodStep><description><section><title>Vessel Interaction Observation</title>
<para>Vessel sightings and interactions were recorded on Interaction Data Sheets.  The date, camera, location, begin and end time, and vessel category, including estimated size, were recorded. Records noted whether seals had been observed (counted) before the vessel was observed and whether seals were observed entering water while the vessel was present.  As viewing opportunities allowed, interactions were described. Descriptions recorded vessel approach, movement, and heading in relation to focal groups of seals. Counts, if applicable, were conducted approximately every 5 minutes on the focal group and/or entire glacial face area.  For an interaction/sighting that occurred at Aialik Glacier, both the Squab Island. and Aialik glacier cameras were used to record and take pictures for subsequent analysis.</para>
