 <abstract><para>Two remotely operated video cameras were installed near common murre (Uria aalge) field observation posts at E. Amatuli Island on 22 May. Live images were transmitted to Homer by microwave via a repeater atop Mt. Bede, on the southwestern Kenai Peninsula. Between 23 June and 4 September Pratt Museum and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service staff worked in the museum with the cameras as public interpreters and data collectors. They helped teach nearly 15,000 visitors about seabirds, predator-prey relationships, habitat, and scientific research. Productivity data for a selected study plot was collected by camera at the museum and by observers in the field using binoculars and telescopes. Comparison of data sets revealed variations between data from camera and field observations. With camera observation fewer murres were counted, adult postures more frequently misidentified, eggs and chicks less frequently seen, and different hatch dates recorded. Calculated results for measures of
productivity were similar between the two methods, however. Public interaction with interpreter/data collectors greatly enhanced education and outreach but may have been one factor responsible for variation between camera-derived and field-derived data. Electronic interference, problems of hardware/software design, and delayed field maintenance were among other factors influencing camera effectiveness. These data include raw counts only and do not include vistitor participation data.

 <para>A remotely-controlled video camera was installed to view cliff areas that contained Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge study plots on East Amatuli Island; images were broadcast to the Pratt Museum. The camera was installed before egg-laying had begun in the plots and was removed after the last chick had fledged. Refuge personnel collected data in the field also during this period. Camera and field observations followed Refuge protocol. For each nest in the plot, during each day of observations, adult incubation and brooding postures, and (when possible) nest-site content (empty, egg, chick) were noted and adults were counted.</para>
 <para>Camera observations for measurement of reproductive success (productivity) were made usually in late morning. Counts of adults in the plot were made as close to 1300 hrs as practicable. In the field, productivity measurements were made at various times of day and adults were counted as close to 1400 hrs as possible. The duration of each camera productivity session was about 30 to 45 minutes; each field observation averaged 30 minutes. Camera observations were sometimes combined with interpretation for museum visitors. When not combined with interpretation, productivity observations with the camera took 15-30 minutes. Counts of adults on this plot took 5-10 minutes with the camera and 1 minute in the field. Some images viewed with the camera were recorded on video tape for review by the field crew upon their return from the field.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Camera Observations</title>
 <para>The camera was located within 3 meters of the field observer post and about 20-30 meters from the nearest plot; this plot was used for comparisons of field and camera observations. At first a camera with an 18X-power zoom was used; this proved to be inadequate for observation of this plot; it was replaced with a 20X camera partway though the season.</para>
 <para>Camera observations were made on 46 days during the 24 June-1 September period; the observation interval was every 1-3 days except during the 11-day interval of 23 July-2 August, when technical problems with the camera prevented data collection. One observer made most (26 days) of the camera observations. Two others observed on 10 days, and on 10 days the name of the observer was not recorded.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Field Observations</title>
 <para>Field observations of murres on the study plot were made on 29 days during 23 June-4 September at intervals of 1-6 days. Field observations of this plot were shared between 2 people (1 person per day) and took about 1 minute to count. Productivity measurements were made at various times of day and adults were counted as close to 1400 hrs as possible. Each field observation averaged 30 minutes.</para>
 </section>
 </description>
 </methodStep>
 <methodStep><description><section><title>Productivity Analysis</title>
 <para>Methods for recording and analyzing productivity data collected with the camera were the same as those used for field data. Data from the daily records were compiled and dates were determined for the last observation of an empty nest-site, the first and last time an egg was seen, and the first and last time a chick was seen. These dates were recorded on a summary spreadsheet and egg-laying, egg-hatching, and chick-fledging dates were calculated, and a mean hatch date was determined. Finally, the number of eggs laid, chicks hatched, and chicks fledged were summed for the plot. Camera results for hatching success (chicks/eggs), fledgling success (fledglings/chicks), and productivity (fledglings/eggs) were compared with results from the field observations with a likelihood ratio chi-square Test, at the 0.1 significance level. Hatch dates were compared with a 2-tailed t-test, at the 0.1 significance level. Counts of adults made during the census period (between peak egg-laying and the start of fledging, when adult attendance at the cliff is most stable) with the camera and in the field were compared with a 2-tailed t-test, at the 0.1 significance level.</para>
