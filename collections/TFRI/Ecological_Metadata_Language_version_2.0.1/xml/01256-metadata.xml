Removing both endocarp and seed coat, however, promoted germination in a high percentage of nonstratified seeds. Treatment of intact nonstratified seeds with gibberellic acid (GA3) was only partially effective in breaking dormancy. However, GA3 promoted germination of nonstratified seeds in which the endocarp (but not the seed coat) had been removed. Order of ABA concentration in fresh seeds was endocarp &gt; seed coat &gt; embryo, and its concentration in endocarp plus seed coat was about 6.2-fold higher than that in the embryo. Total ABA contents of seeds subjected to warm and/or cold moist stratification were reduced 6~12-fold. A higher concentration of GA4 was detected in embryos of nondormant than in those of dormant seeds. Fluridone, an ABA biosynthesis inhibitor, was efficient in breaking dormancy of Prunus seeds. Paclobutrazol, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, completely inhibited seed germination, and the inhibitory effect could be partially reversed by GA4 but not by GA3. Thus, dormancy in P. campanulata seeds is imposed by the covering layers. Dormancy-break is accompanied by a decrease in ABA in covering layers and embryo and germination by an increase of GA4 in embryo.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>abscisic acid</keyword><keyword>cold and warm stratification</keyword><keyword>endocarp</keyword><keyword>fluridone</keyword><keyword>gibberellins</keyword><keyword>paclobutrazol</keyword><keyword>Prunus campanulata</keyword><keyword>seed coat</keyword><keyword>seed dormancy</keyword><keyword>germination</keyword></keywordSet><coverage scope="document"><taxonomicCoverage scope="document"><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Genus</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>Prunus</taxonRankValue><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Species</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>campanulata</taxonRankValue></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Taiwan</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>119.75</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>122.125</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>25.625</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>21.875</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact id="1164692878474" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ching-Te</givenName><surName>Chien</surName></individualName><organizationName>Taiwan Forestry Research Institute</organizationName><positionName>Senior Researcher</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>53 Nanhai Rd., Taipei 10066, Taiwan</deliveryPoint><city>Taipei</city><administrativeArea>Taiwan</administrativeArea><postalCode>10066</postalCode><country>Taiwan</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">02-20309978ext2011</phone><electronicMailAddress>chien@serv.tfri.gov.tw</electronicMailAddress></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Plant materials</title><para>Fruits of Prunus campanulata were collected in the field when they were mature, i.e. dark red or dark purple. More than 5000 mature fruits were collected from 5 trees at Alishan (23032&#8217;N, 120047&#8217;E), Chiayi County, central Taiwan at 2,000 m elevation in early May 2002. A small amount of green immature fruits also were collected 3 weeks before maturity. Seeds were extracted by removing the pulp (exocarp + mesocarp) in water, and the clean sunken seeds (with endocarp) were used for subsequent treatments. Seeds of P. campanulata are 8-9 mm in length and consist of a large embryo and a thin seed coat adhered to the small amount of endosperm. The seed is surrounded by a hard endocarp (Fig. 1). Thus, the word &#8220;seed&#8221; in this paper refers to the true seed plus endocarp, which is the germination unit in Prunus. Moisture content was determined for both fresh and treated seeds using three replications of 20 seeds each and calculated on a fresh-weight basis after oven drying for 17 hours at 103oC (ISTA, 1999).</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Effect of moist warm and moist cold stratification on germination</title><para>Freshly harvested seeds were placed on moist sphagnum in sealable polyethylene bags and warm-moist stratified for 4 or 6 weeks at 30/20oC (12/12 h) with 12 hours fluorescent light (80~100 &#181;Mol m-2 s-1) during the higher temperature portion of the regime.

To enhance passage of GA3 solutions through the endocarp and seed coat, seeds with the various GA3 concentrations were placed in a vacuum container at a pressure of 30 cm Hg (0.4 atmospheric pressure) for 16 or 72 hours. Seeds with the endocarp removed also were treated with the above-described GA3 concentrations in addition to 0.26 mM GA3 for 16 hours. Each treatment consisted of 3 replicates of 50 seeds each.

Sphagnum served as the germination medium. Seeds were considered to have germinated when the radicle was at least 5 mm long. Germination was recorded weekly, and results were expressed as percent germination and as mean germination time (MGT) in days (Naylor, 1981). MGT = (&#931;niti)/N, where ni is the number of seeds germinated in ti days from the beginning of the test, and N is the total number of germinated seeds at the end of the test. MGT is a measure of the rate of germination and of the sharpness of the germination peak.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Growth regulator analyses</title><para>The endocarp, seed coat (with adhering endosperm), embryo (cotyledons + axis) and pulp (exocarp + mesocarp) were separated individually from immature fruits collected 3 weeks before maturity (green pulp) and from freshly mature fruits (dark red or dark purple). Further, the endocarp, seed coat and embryo were separated from seeds (endocarp + true seed) warm moist-stratified only at 30/20oC for 6 weeks, from seeds cold moist-stratified only at 4oC for 12 weeks, from seeds warm moist-stratified at 30/20oC for 6 weeks and then cold moist-stratified at 4oC for 8 weeks (nondormant seeds) and from germinated seeds. In all cases, parts were separated from 50 fruits or seeds, lyophilized and weighed. Then, two replications of each fruit/seed part were stored at -80oC until they could be analyzed for the growth regulators ABA and GAs. Levels of endogenous ABA, GA1, GA3, GA4, GA7 and GA20 were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-selected ion monitoring (GC-MS-SIM).</para><para>Embryos, seed coats and pulp were ground separately in liquid N2 using a mortar and pestle, and the endocarps were finely pulverized using an ultracentrifugal mill (Retsch, Germany). Origin of the internal standards were added to each sample after grinding as follows: 100 ng of [2H6]ABA and 50 ng of [17,17-2H2]GAs (GA1, GA3, GA4, GA7 and GA20). Tissue extraction was carried out overnight with 15 ml of 80% (v/v) MeOH containing 0.4 mg of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and 2 mg of ascorbate at 4oC, and the residue was re-extracted in the same solvent for 2 hours at 4oC. The MeOH extracts were combined and reduced to 1~2 ml of water residue using both prepurified N2 airflow and SpeedVac (Savant Instruments, Massachusetts, USA).</para><para>The residue with internal standards was adjusted to pH 8.5 with 0.05 M K-Pi buffer and passed through a polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) column (approximately 5 g). The eluate was partitioned with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (3 x 15 ml). The aqueous fraction was then adjusted to pH 3.0 with 0.5 M K-Pi buffer (pH 2.0) and partitioned with EtOAc (3 x 15 ml). The pooled EtOAc fraction was taken to dryness by the SpeedVac. The residue was dissolved in 0.05 M K-Pi buffer (pH 3.0) and loaded onto a preconditioned ODS-silica column (approximately 3 g). The ODS-silica column was washed 3 times with ddH2O in 0.1% HOAc and eluted with 80% aqueous MeOH containing 0.1% HOAc.</para><para>Following drying in vacuo using the SpeedVac, the sample was dissolved in 30% aqueous MeOH containing 0.1% acetic acid and injected onto a Beckman System Gold HPLC with LiChrosphere RP-18 column (250 x 4 mm i.d. x 5-&#181;m particle size, Merck, Germany) for further separation of ABA and GAs. Running conditions for HPLC were similar to those described by Nakayama et al. (2001) as follows: solvent A was 100% MeOH and solvent B 30% aqueous MeOH containing 0.1% HOAc; 0~2 min, 0% solvent A; 2~42 min, 0~100% solvent A; 42~52 min, 100% solvent A; flow rate, 0.6 ml min-1; fractionation, at 1 min intervals. Appropriate retention times of ABA and the GAs in HPLC: 17~20 min, GA1 and GA3; 26~28 min, GA20 and ABA; 29~30 min, GA7; and 34~35 min, GA4.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>GC-MS-SIM analysis</title><para>The HPLC fractions were dried using SpeedVac and derivatized by adding ethereal diazomethane, then dried with N2.
