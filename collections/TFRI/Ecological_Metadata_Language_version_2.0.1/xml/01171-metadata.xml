The microfibril angles (MFAs) of the S2 layer of cell wall also were measured by the iodine deposition method to examine their relationships with the growth strain. We found that the magnitude of the compressive stress on the lower side of sweeping trunks was greater than that of the tensile stresses in straight trunks. However, transverse compressive stress was found to be similar around the trunk regardless of normal and compression wood. The released surface growth strains varied with the variation of MFAs. The growth stress changed from tension to compression at 20&#8728;~ 25&#8728;, and the compressive stress increased dramatically in the compression wood region. 
Branches suffer bending stress due to its self-weight. This stress is then superposed on the growth stress. It was found that growth strains on the upper side or lower side of branches were larger than those in the stems. It suggests that the generation of growth stress on the lower side of branch containing highly developed compression wood is affected by the gravitational bending stress due to its self-weight. We concluded that the branch form is affected by the interaction between the bending moment due to its self-weight and that due to the asymmetric growth stress distribution. Three types of branches, that is, horizontal (or slant), bending upwards and bending downwards, showed different status of growth strain distribution in branch.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>compression wood</keyword><keyword>growth strain</keyword><keyword>microfibril angle</keyword><keyword>residual internal stress</keyword><keyword>spring back strain</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>There are no restriction for this document.</para></intellectualRights><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Taiwan</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>119.75</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>122.125</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>25.5</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>22.0</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2005-01-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2005-12-31</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><taxonomicCoverage scope="document"><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Species</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>Chamaecyparis formosensis Matsum</taxonRankValue><commonName>Taiwan Red Cypress</commonName></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicCoverage></coverage><contact id="1164704010952" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Huang</givenName><surName>Yan-San</surName></individualName><organizationName>Div. of Forest Utilization, Taiwan Forestry Research Institute</organizationName><positionName>Senior scientist</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>53 Nan-Hai Road</deliveryPoint><city>Taipei</city><postalCode>100</postalCode><country>Taiwan</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">02-23039978ext2612</phone><phone phonetype="fax">02-23035738</phone><electronicMailAddress>yansan@ serv.tfri.gov.tw</electronicMailAddress></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><title>surface growth strain</title><para>The trees (A, B, C, D, E and F) have 17, 22, 23, 27, 34.5 and 40 cm diameter at breast height (DBH), and 15,16,16,17,18 and 18.5 m height, respectively. In measuring the surface growth strain, longitudinal and transverse strains were measured. After removing the bark at specified positions, electrical resistance strain gauges were attached to the xylem in both longitudinal and transverse directions, with cyanoacrylate adhesive. A portable digital strain meter (Model UCAM &#8211; 1A Kyowa Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a 40- channel scanner (USB &#8211; 11A) was used for measurement. After calibrating the strain gauges to zero, the surface growth strain was released by the kerf method (Sasaki et al. 1978), i.e., grooves 1 &#8211;1.5 cm deep were made in the xylem around the strain gauge with a handsaw and chain saw and the released strain was determined immediately. To determine the effect of tree height on growth strain, the trees were felled. Then, the trunks were cross cut every 2.0 &#8211; 2.5 m, and the longitudinal surface strains were measured by the kerf method at the middle point of each segment. For tree E, a diametral plank, 30 cm long and 2 cm thick, located at 5.3 m height of trunk, was obtained by chain saw and hand plane. Strain gauges were glued at the center of the length of plank at intervals of 1.5 cm radially, in the longitudinal direction. Longitudinal residual strains on the diametral plank were then measured by cross &#8211; cutting the plank with a handsaw at 1 cm above the strain gauges and then ripping among the gauges. In addition, specimens of 1 cm (width)&#61620; 1 cm (thickenss) &#61620; 18 cm (length), matched with the strain measuring position, were sampled from the plank and used in a static bending test to measure the modulus of elasticity which was used to calculate growth stresses. Specific gravity and modulus of rupture were also determined. Measurements of the peripheral distributions of growth strains were made on standing tree E at the circumference of the curving part of basal sweeping trunks with 22.5&#61616; &#8211; 45&#61616; interval. The upper side of trunk was assigned as 0&#61616;, and the lower side as 180&#61616;. Since compression wood has occurred at the lower side of leaning trunk, accumulated strain measurements were made along this side (Figure 1).</para><para>Microfibril angles (MFAs) were measured by the iodine &#8211; staining method. Several tangential &#8211; sliced samples, 20 &#956;m in thickness, were cut from the outermost annual ring at each strain measuring position. The MFAs were measured in approximately 30 tracheids at each point, and the average value of early and late wood was calculated. Each average was compared with the magnitude of the released surface growth strain.</para><para>Several branches were selected from young trees having DBH ranging from 4 cm to 20 cm to measure the growth strains at different distances away from the trunk. After removing the bark, strain gauges were glued in the longitudinal direction at the upper side and the lower side of the specified position of the branch. After zeroing the gauges, the branch was cut down and its spring back strain owing to self weigh could be read. Thereafter, growth strains could be measured by cross &#8211; cutting the branch at a position 5 mm in the front and behind the strain gauge. MFAs were also measured on the upper side, side and lower side of branch at specified position.</para></section></description></methodStep></methods><access authSystem="knb" order="denyFirst"
