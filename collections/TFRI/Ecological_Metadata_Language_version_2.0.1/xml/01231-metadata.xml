Dry weight and the yields of 10-deacetyl baccatin III (10-DAB), taxol, and total taxanes per plant at 3 harvesting times were not significantly different between two strengths of JS, only the 11 month-old plants produced greater taxol in 1/20 JS. Great variations of these two parameters in 3 organs (leaves, stems and roots) of plants among 4 clones were found. Wx grew poorly and produced little taxanes. Nj11 grew fast with the greatest taxanes. T1 had growth rate similar to K3, but with greater taxanes. Nj11 was a 10-DAB rich clone, a 11 month-old plant produced 5.83 mg. Whereas T1 was the taxol rich clone, it produced 1.16 mg per plant. Usually 10-DAB was rich in needles, while taxol was rich in roots. However, T1&amp;rsquos needles contained taxol greater than its roots. The concentrations of both 10-DAB and taxol achieved the greatest amount in Dec than the other two harvesting months. Although 11 month-old plants gave the greatest biomass, the taxanes increased a little when compared to 9 month-old ones. Since most of potted plants died and grew poorly during the culture period, suggesting that water culture is a good tool to rapidly evaluate the clonal performance of Taiwan yew.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>clonal test</keyword><keyword>taxanes,</keyword><keyword>Taxus mairei,</keyword><keyword>water culture.</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>If you want to use the information, please contact with me</para></intellectualRights><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>The experiment was carried out at Taipei Botanical Garden.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>119.875</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>121.5</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>27.375</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>19.25</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2000-02-29</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2001-03-30</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><taxonomicCoverage scope="document"><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Genus</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>Taxus</taxonRankValue><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Species</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>smatrana</taxonRankValue><commonName>Taiwan yew</commonName></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><references>1154411364609</references></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><title>1.Material</title><para>Four clones of Taxus mairei were selected.

Rooted cuttings of 4 clones were obtained on 12 December 1996 after cutting for 3 months in the greenhouse at Taipei Botanic Garden. They were transplanted into plastic pots (4 &#215; 4 &#215; 21 cm in length, width and height) containing with 1:1 ratio of vermiculite and peat and 1 g nutrient coat. After nursing in greenhouse for 3 months (from March 12 to 28, 1997), they were removed from pots, rinsed the roots with tap water. Each shoot and root parts of a plant was immersed into 500-mL beaker containing 450 mL, respectively, and the weight gains after subtracting the water weight were acted as the volume of each part.. To understand the dry weights of 4 clones, another 4 plants of each were sampled and oven dried at 70&#8451; for two days.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>2.Culture Environment</title><para>The plants were grown in a shelter with 60% light off at Taipei Botanical Garden.

The tissue (1 g) was freeze dried and ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle. The powdered tissue was extracted 2 times with 20 ml of methanol by sonication, each extraction for 30 min. After sonication, the combined methanolic extract was transfer into glass tube (16 mm x 100 mm) and evaporated to dryness at 40&#8451; in vacuum evaporator (Zymark Crop., Hopkinton, MA, USA).  For analysis, 1 ml methanol was added to the residue and vortexed for 20 seconds, the mixture was filtered through a 0.2 &#956;m filter (Whatman Inc., Fairfield, NJ), The filtrate solution transferred to clean glass vials for analysis.</para><para>Isocratic analytical HPLC was performed on a Perkin elmer HPLC  system with a 2996 system photodiode-array detector. (Milford. MA, USA) using a Chromolith Performance RP-18 monolithic column {5&#956;m, 150x4.6mm}(Supelco Disscovery, Bellefonte, PA, USA). The mobile phase for alkaloid elution was 0.03M methanol:acetonitrile:H2O (20:38:42), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a sample size of 10&#956;l and UV detection at 230nm Retention times for DB, BC and taxol were 3.3 min, 5.2min and 21.6 min, . The quantification of peak area was based on the calibration using a external standard of DB, BC and taxol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).  10-DAB, taxol and total taxanes (the sum of 10-DAB, baccatin, 10-deacetyl taxol, cephalomanine, taxol and 7-epi-10-deacetyltaxol) was determined following the procedure and the same HPLC as reported by Ho et al. (2001). Only the yields of 10-DAB, BC, taxol, and total taxanes (the sum of 6 components) per plant were analyzed by SAS to evaluate the changes during the culture period.</para></section></description><instrumentation>Perkin Elmer HPLC</instrumentation></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>4.Data  Analysis</title><para>Plant growth increase in fresh and dry weight and taxane concentrations was determined after 6 months (5 Sep. 1997), 9 months (5 Dec. 1997) and 11 month (2 Feb. 1998) in culture. At data collection date 4 plants of each clone were randomly taken from each vessel. Since taxane concentration and water content in different parts of a plant varied greatly, plants were separated as needle, stems (the total weight of needles and stem = shoot weight) and root parts, and were weighed respectively. Plants of each part were collected, grinded with methanol and determined concentrations of taxanes each as described below. The extracted residues were oven dried at 70&#8451; for two days as to be dry weights. Taxane yields per parts of a plant were calculated as the concentration of each component (ppm) times its dry weight, and then the total taxane yield per plant was obtained by adding together of all the yields of each part. The data were analyzed by GLM, SAS (SAS users Guide 1985) to evaluate the effect of the different clones, the concentrations of JS solution, and the culture period on the growth and taxane yield per plants.</para></section></description></methodStep></methods><access authSystem="knb" order="denyFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access><dataTable id="1164871548710" scope="document"><entityName>Clonal test-HPLC.csv</entityName><physical id="1164871546118" scope="document"><objectName>Clonal test-HPLC.csv</objectName><size unit="byte">23370</size><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><recordDelimiter>#x0A</recordDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">ecogrid://knb/shchang.21.1</url></online></distribution></physical><attributeList><attribute id="1164871548726" scope="document"><attributeName>Date</attributeName><attributeLabel>date</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>ANALYSIS DATE</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>yyyymmdd</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute><attribute id="1164871548742" scope="document"><attributeName>CODE</attributeName><attributeLabel>cell line</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>CELL LINE</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>CELL LINE</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute><attribute id="1164871548757" scope="document"><attributeName>COLOR</attributeName><attributeLabel>color</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>CELL COLOR</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>CELL COLOR</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute><attribute id="1164871548773" scope="document"><attributeName>VOL</attributeName><attributeLabel>cell vol</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>CELL VOLUME%</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><interval><unit><standardUnit>cubicCentimetersPerCubicCentimeters</standardUnit></unit><precision>0.1</precision><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></interval></measurementScale></attribute><attribute id="1164871548788" scope="document"><attributeName>TOTAL</attributeName><attributeLabel>total taxanes</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>TOTAL TAXANES</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><interval><unit><standardUnit>milligramsPerLiter</standardUnit></unit><precision>0.1</precision><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></interval></measurementScale></attribute><attribute id="1164871548804" scope="document"><attributeName>BC</attributeName><attributeLabel>BC content</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>AMOUNT OF BC</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><interval><unit><standardUnit>milligramsPerLiter</standardUnit></unit><precision>0.1</precision><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></interval></measurementScale></attribute><attribute id="1164871548820" scope="document"><attributeName>TX</attributeName><attributeLabel>TX content</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>AMOUNT OF TX</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><interval><unit><standardUnit>milligramsPerLiter</standardUnit></unit><precision>0.1</precision><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></interval></measurementScale></attribute></attributeList><numberOfRecords>563</numberOfRecords></dataTable></dataset></ns0:eml>
