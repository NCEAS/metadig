Incubation at 35/10&#8451; or stratification at 4&#8451;prior to incubation of freshly harvested seeds significantly increased germination percentage from less than 5% to greater than 87%.  Germination percentage was increased only slightly in intact seeds treated with up to 2000 ppm GA3.  However, partial removal of the seed coat by mechanical scarfication plus GA3 resulted in a drastic increase in both germination percentage and rate.  Storage in liquid nitrogen for one and seven months enhanced germination percentage and the beneficial action was due to cracking of the seed coat.  Embryos excised from their enclosing tissues and embryos surrounded by endosperm germinated to a much higher percentage than intact seeds, indicating that the water-permeable seed coat plays a mechanical role in preventing radicle protrusion in nontreated intact seeds.  Improved germination responses were obtained when the physiological dormant seeds of P. amurense var. wilsonii were pre-treated for 3 months of cold stratification, whilst GA3 treatments also promoted their germination.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>dormancy</keyword><keyword>germination in seeds</keyword><keyword>Phellodendron amurense var. wilsonii</keyword><keyword>gibberellin</keyword></keywordSet><coverage scope="document"><taxonomicCoverage scope="document"><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Genus</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>Phellodendron</taxonRankValue><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Species</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>amurense</taxonRankValue></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicCoverage></coverage><contact id="1164696752470" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ching-Te</givenName><surName>Chien</surName></individualName><organizationName>Taiwan Forestry Research Institute</organizationName><positionName>Senior researcher</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>53 Nanhai Rd., Taipei 10066, Taiwan</deliveryPoint><city>Taipei</city><administrativeArea>Taiwan</administrativeArea><postalCode>10066</postalCode><country>Taiwan</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">02-23039978ext2011</phone><electronicMailAddress>chien@serv.tfri.gov.tw</electronicMailAddress></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><title>seed collection and preparation</title><para>Mature black fruits of P. amurense var. wilsonii were harvested from Taiping Mountain (24&#176;30&#8217;N, 121&#176;29&#8217;E), Ilan County, northeastern Taiwan, at an elevation of 1600 m in September 2004. The fruits are very oily and aromatic. Fruits harvested from natural forests or plantations should be rapidly transported to the handling place to avoid decreases in viability of the seedlots due to high temperatures in the transport-containers (Chien personal observation). Each fruit contains 3~6 seeds (average 5), but some of them are empty. Fruits were macerated by hand in water, and the empty seeds were floated off and discarded. The clean sunken seeds were used for subsequent treatments. The black seed (4~6 mm long and 2~3 mm wide) consists of the seed coat and a large dicotyledonous embryo surrounded by a small amount endosperm (figure 1). The spatulate embryo (Martin, 1946) is fully developed with a mean (&#177; SE) embryo length : seed length ratio of 0.83 &#177; 0.02 (n = 15), and it does not grow within the seed before the radicle emerges. Moisture content (MC) of seeds was determined with three replicates of 20 seeds and calculated on a fresh-weight basis after oven drying for 17 hours at 103&#176;C (ISTA, 1999).</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Imbibition</title><para>Each of 20 non-scarified and scarified (cut at the point away from embryonic axis) seeds were weighed individually to the nearest 0.1 mg at time 0 and after incubation at ambient laboratory temperature (~24&#176;C) for 24 hours on Whatman no. 1 filter paper in Petri dishes moistened with distilled water.

These warm-stratified seeds were then given 4, 8, 12, 16 or 20 weeks of cold moist stratification at 4&#176;C. A cold stratification treatment without a warm treatment was also carried out on fresh seeds in moist sphagnum for 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks prior to the seeds being subjected to germination tests.

Germination tests of warm- followed by cold-stratified seeds or of cold-stratified seeds only were performed at 30/20&#176;C, i.e. same temperature as that for warm stratification. Sphagnum served as the germination medium. Germination, i.e. radicle at least 5 mm long, was recorded weekly. Results were expressed as percentage germination after 12 weeks and as the mean germination time (MGT) in days.
