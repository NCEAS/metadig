Freshly
harvested mature seeds germinated to about 70% in 12 weeks at 30/20&#176;C alternating temperatures. Moist
stratification at 4&#176;C prior to incubation of fresh seeds significantly increased germination rate and the mean
germination time decreased from 53 days to 23 days in 2 months, and to 17 days in 5 months. Immersing seeds
in concentrated sulphuric acid for 80-90 minutes significantly increased germination percentage and rate. Seeds
of T. cannabina survived desiccation to both 4.9% and 9.6% moisture contents (MC) (fresh weight basis) and
storage at 4 and 15&#176;C, respectively, for 24 months without a loss of germinability, whereas those that were
desiccated to 14.4% and 16.2% MC lost their germination from 65% to 0-35% under the same storage condition
and period. Seeds stored at -20&#176;C with 4.9% and 9.6% MC drastically reduced their germination from 65% to
below 10% in one year and seeds at the same subzero temperature with 14.4% or higher MC did not survive in
one month. Thus, T. cannabina exhibited intermediate seed storage behaviour.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Trema cannabina</keyword><keyword>Seed germination</keyword><keyword>Seed storage</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>&#20677;&#20379;&#23416;&#34899;&#21443;&#32771;&#29992;</para></intellectualRights><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>&#21488;&#28771;&#20840;&#23798;</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>119.875</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>122.125</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>25.5</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>21.625</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><singleDateTime><calendarDate>2002-09-15</calendarDate></singleDateTime></temporalCoverage><taxonomicCoverage scope="document"><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Family</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>Ulmaceae</taxonRankValue><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Genus</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>Trema</taxonRankValue><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Species</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>cannabina</taxonRankValue></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><references>1154058666272</references></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Seeds</title><para>Fruits of T. cannabina become reddish orange color when they are mature.
