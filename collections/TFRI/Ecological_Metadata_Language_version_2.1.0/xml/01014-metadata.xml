 <abstract><para>Available information on seed dormancy for various members of the Saxifragales and phylogenetic relationships
within this order allowed us to accurately predict thatDaphniphyllumglaucescens seeds havemorphophysiological
dormancy (MPD). However, our hypothesis that seeds had deep simple epicotyl MPD, i.e., nondeep physiological
dormancy (PD) in root and deep PD in shoot, was not supported. Both the root and the shoot (cotyledons) of the
underdevelopedembryo of D. glaucescens have nondeepPD. Exposure tomoderate (15/6, 20/10C), rather than
high (25/15C), temperatures for 10&#8211;12 wk broke the PDof the hypocotyl/root. After hypocotyl emergence, seeds
with an attached developing root system did not require cold stratification to break the PD of the shoot. The PD of
the shoot was broken by an additional 10&#8211;12 wk at moderate temperatures, during which time cotyledons slowly
grew inside the seed. As cotyledons grew, all of the hypocotyl was pushed out of the seed, and the final cotyledon
length was almost twice that of the seed; at this point, the folded cotyledons emerged. Since the level of PD in root
and shoot may or may not be the same, we advocate stating the level of PD in both root and shoot when epicotyl
MPD is described in a species. Thus, seeds of D. glaucescens have nondeep simple (root)&#8211;nondeep simple (epicotyl)
MPD, which is written as C1bB(root)-C1bB(shoot) in the formula system of Nikolaeva. This is the first report of this
level of epicotyl MPD in the Saxifragales.</para>

 <para>Ripe fruits were collected from trees of Daphniphyllum glaucescens growing at Yang-Ming-Shan, Taiwan (lat. 25099N, long. 121339E, 500 m asl) on October 19, November 10, and December 1, 2005, and October 5, 2006. The fruits are drupes; therefore, the exocarp and fleshy mesocarp were removed, leaving the endocarp around the true seed (hereafter, the germination unit consisting of the endocarp plus the true seed is called a &#8216;&#8216;seed&#8217;&#8217;). Seeds were washed with water and allowed to dry at room temperatures for several days, after which they weresent by air mail to the University of Kentucky. Germination studies were initiated within ;3 wk of seed collection. Seeds were incubated on sand moistened with distilled water in 9-cmdiameter plastic Petri dishes.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Hypocotyl and Shoot Emergence</title>
 <para>For seeds collected in October 2005, rates of hypocotyl and shoot emergence were determined at alternating temperature regimes of 5/1, 15/6, 20/10, and 25/15C. In the 5/1C  regime, seeds were exposed to 12 h of light each day at 5C and 12 h of darkness at 1C. In the other temperature regimes, seeds were incubated in light for 14 h each day; lights in the incubators were set to come on 1 h before the beginning of the high-temperature period and to go off 1 h after the beginning of the low-temperature period. Seeds were exposed to 40 mmol m2 s1 of cool white fluorescent light, 400&#8211;700 nm. Three replicates of 25 seeds each were placed in light at each temperature regime, and seeds were monitored at 2-wk intervals for 46 wk. The first indication of germination was emergence of</para>
 <para>the hypocotyl, and when it was 1 mm long, the seed was moved to another Petri dish (at the same temperature). After hypocotyl emergence, seeds were monitored for cotyledon emergence. This study was repeated with seeds collected on the other three dates, with similar results. To determine whether rates of hypocotyl and cotyledon emergence are promoted by simulated seasonal temperature changes, seeds collected in December 2005 were subjected to increasing and decreasing temperatures, i.e., a move-along study, using three replicates of 25 seeds each as described above (see legend in fig. 2 for the sequences of moves to different temperatures). All seeds were monitored for hypocotyl and cotyledon emergence at 2-wk intervals for 46 wk. This study was repeated using seeds collected in October 2006, with very similar results. Mean (6SE) percentages of seeds with an emerged hypocotyl</para>
 <para>and shoot were calculated. Percentage of seeds with an emerged hypocotyl was based on number of viable seeds in each dish, and percentage of seeds with an emerged shoot was based on number of seeds with an emerged hypocotyl in each dish.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Temperature Requirement for Cotyledon Emergence</title>
 <para>To determine whether cotyledon emergence was promoted by daily exposure to cold-stratifying temperatures (10C each day under the 20/10C regime and 6C each day under the 15/6C regime), seeds with and without emerged hypocotyls were transferred from 20/10 to 25/15C. Seeds collected in October 2006 were incubated on wet sand in light at 20/ 10C for 0, 6, 8, 12, and 14 wk and were then transferred to 25/15C; a control was kept at 20/10C. Three replications of 25 seeds each were used for each condition, and all seeds were checked for hypocotyl and cotyledon emergence at 2-wk intervals for 28 wk. Mean 6 SE percentages of seeds with an emerged hypocotyl (based on number of viable seeds) and emerged cotyledons (based on number of seeds with emerged</para>
 <para>hypocotyls) were calculated.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Embryo Growth before Hypocotyl Emergence</title>
 <para>To determine whether embryos grow inside seeds before germination, embryo growth was monitored in seeds collected in October 2005. Seeds were incubated on moist sand in light(14 h daily light period) at 15/6, 20/10, and 25/15C. At 2-wk intervals for 10 wk, embryos were excised from each of 15 seeds at each temperature and measured. Embryos were excised with a razor blade and a dissecting microscope equipped with a micrometer, which was used to measure embryos. To determine the length that embryos must reach before germination occurs, embryos were excised and measured from 15 seeds that were beginning to germinate, i.e., in which the seed coat (endocarp) had split but none of the hypocotyl had emerged; these seeds had been incubated at 20/10C for 8 or 10 wk. Each time embryos were measured, mean embryo length 6 SE was calculated.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Embryo Growth after Hypocotyl Emergence</title>
 <para>At the time of hypocotyl emergence, the shoot (consisting of part of the hypocotyl, the cotyledons, and the axis) remains inside the seed, and our observations indicated that it could be many weeks before shoot emergence occurred. To determine whether additional embryo growth occurs after hypocotyl emergence and before cotyledon emergence, shoot length (inside the seed) was monitored between time of hypocotyl emergence and cotyledon emergence. Seeds collected in November 2005 were incubated in light at 20/10C; 25 dishes with 25 seeds each were used. At 6 wk, seed coats (endocarp) began to split on a few seeds, and at 10 wk, the hypocotyl began to</para>
 <para>emerge from a few seeds. At 1-wk intervals (starting at 6 wk), seeds in all dishes were examined, and the length of the protruding hypocotyl (or hypocotyl plus root) was measured. Eventually, 15 seeds with a split seed coat and an external (protruding) hypocotyl/root length of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26&#8211;32, 40&#8211;60, and 70&#8211;120 mm were found, and embryos were excised from them. After embryo excision, the length of the hypocotyl and/or cotyledons inside each seed was measured. It took 34 wk to find 15 seeds in each size category. The length of the external hypocotyl plus root was used to judge size categories instead of time of incubation because on any given date there was a range of sizes; i.e., seedlings grew at different rates. Also, at the beginning of the study, the length of 15 intact, imbibed seeds was measured, and then their embryos were excised and measured.</para>
