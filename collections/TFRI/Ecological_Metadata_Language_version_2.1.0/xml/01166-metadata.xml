<abstract><para>Typhoon morakot produced copious amount of rainfall and
        triggered enormous landslides in southern Taiwan during it hit
        Taiwan from August 8 to 9, 2009. The Liukuei Experimental Forest
        (LEF) is located in the peak rainfall region and was inescapable
        incurred severe landslides and road destruction. This paper
        presents a ststistical approach to study the spatial
        relationship between landslides and their geographical factors
        in the LEF after the Typhoon Morakot. The Formosat-2 satellite
        images, 10*10DEM data and the related coverage of LEF were
        examined using the WinGrid computer software for topographical
        analysis. The results indicated that the extreme heavy rainfall
        is the main factor that triggered landslides huring the typhoon.
        There were 204 locations occurred identifiacable landslides and
        their total area was about 804.5 ha. The altitude and type of
        vegetation covers were not factors related to the failure of
        slopes. Stepness, aspect, and distances to roads and streams
        were factors that contribute the instability of slopes. About
        70.2% of the total area of landslides occurred on slopes with
        steepness in the range of 60-80% and this explained that steep
        slopes are prone to collapse. landslides having the distance of
        lower edge to stream less than 10 m are 49 locations and their
        areas account for 47.2% of the total landslide areas. In
        addition, there are 34 landslides (24.5%) within 50 m from
        forest roads and the average area of those landslides is 5.79
        ha. The deep concentrated surface flows resulted from extreme
        rainfall in the streams or on road surfaces strike against the
        foot of hillslope copes with saturated soil water were the main
        factors that caused slides in large area. This also indicated
        that landslides in LEF are close related to stream system and
        forest road construction. The aspect of slope is not the main
        factor that related to landslides for most cases. However,
        slopes having southern and southeast aspects were directly faced
        to the strong wind and heavy rainfall brought by typhoon Morakot
        and were occurred more landslides than slopes with other aspects.</para>
