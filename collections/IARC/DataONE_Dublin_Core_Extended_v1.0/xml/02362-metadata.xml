New snow algorism techniques of remote sensing for snow depth and snow-melting area can be carried out using these in-situ data. We have conducted snow survey from 2006 to now, which is mainly on March and occasionally on January and April/May when seasonal snow melts. The sites are located at an interval of ca. 32-km along the Dalton Highway (Fig. 1). Snow density, snow depth and temperature were measured in snow-pit wall observation at each site. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was calculated by multiplying snow-column snow density by snow depth. As the results, the response of SWE to snow depth showed a positively linear relationship (R2 &gt; 0.90).</ns2:abstract><ns2:accessRights>copyright</ns2:accessRights><ns2:spatial xsi:type="dcterms:Box">northlimit=75; southlimit=50; eastlimit=-130; westlimit=-180</ns2:spatial><ns2:temporal>Begin 2006-01-01T15:24:00; End 2015-04-02T15:24:00</ns2:temporal></ns0:dcTerms></ns0:metadata>
