<section>
<para>The dataset contains number of plant species, diversity (within habitat), number (and type) of layers, presence/absence (and type) of management, presence/absence (and type) of natural disturbances, aboveground biomass by indirect methods, presence/absence of groundwater table and presence/absence of susceptibility of the site to drought. Sampling plots are the same used for biomass and LAI measurements in the Orgov&#225;ny LTER (KISKUN LTER) grassland. The aim of the yearly biomass and LAI measurements in the grasslands is to study the effect of weather to the plant production along a productivity gradient. Aboveground living plant biomass and LAI data from 24-30 grassland patches in Orgov&#225;ny region of Kiskuns&#225;g (Kiskuns&#225;g National Park) along a productivity gradient from open sand grassland to reedbed, yearly from 2003 to 2012, were sampled approx. at the time of maximum aboveground biomass. The size of the patches are 20 to 50 sq-m, and each year one 0.5 by 0.5 m sampling unit is selected within each patch. The patches are permanent ones; some of them were omitted and replaced because of disturbance in several years. The aboveground living plant biomass data of separate species are submitted in HU_SI001199_species_biomass_20130508 dataset, and the EUNIS habitat types of the sampled patches are submitted in HU_SI001199_eunis_habitat_type_20130508 dataset.</para>

<para>
<literalLayout>Number of plant species: The aboveground biomass of vascular plants are removed from 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrats for biomass and LAI measurements. In mown grassland, sampling was made right before mowing. Otherwise, the sampling was made approx.at the time of the maximum LAI. As much as possible, clipping was made right at the level of the ground. All plant material was dried at 60&#8304;C until constant weight. After drying, the photosynthesizing vascular plant material seemingly living at time of cutting (i.e. the dry green material) are separated by species. The species samples are weighed separately at precision of 0.01 grams, the number of species counted.
Within habitat diversity: Shannon'H is calculated from vascular plant species dried living biomass data. For one quadrat: m(i) is mass of i-th species, M is total mass, n is number of species, Shannon's H = -SUM(i=1 to n)[(m(i)/M)*log2(m(i)/M)]
Number and type of layers: Visual observation.
Presence and type of management: Visual observation.
Presence of natural disturbances: Visual observation.
Aboveground biomass by indirect methods: Spectroradiometry using CROPCSAN spectroradiometer before sampling for BIOMASS. Aboveground plant biomass measurement, see above. Calculation of NDVI for each measurements: (NIR-RED)/(NIR+RED); Application of linear regression between BIOMASS and NDVI data measured in the same quadrats.
Presence of groundwater table: Expert decision.
Quality of drought susceptibility: Expert decision.</literalLayout>

<para>The sample were taken in grasslands of Orgov&#225;ny LTER site of KISKUN LTER. The data are considered to be representative for the grasslands of KISKUN LTER. Aboveground living plant biomass and LAI data from 24-30 grassland patches in Orgov&#225;ny region of Kiskuns&#225;g (Kiskuns&#225;g National Park) along a productivity gradient from open sand grassland to reedbed, yearly from 2003 to 2012, were sampled approx. at the time of maximum aboveground biomass. The size of the patches are 20 to 50 sq-m, and each year one 0.5 by 0.5 m sampling unit is selected within each patch.

The aboveground living plant biomass data of separate species are submitted in HU_SI001199_species_biomass_20130508 dataset, and the EUNIS habitat types of the sampled patches are submitted in HU_SI001199_eunis_habitat_type_20130508 dataset, the full biomass and LAI data are submitted in HU_SI001199_biomass_lai_20130508 dataset.</para>
