 <abstract><para>Ecosystem services and ecotourism are two primary sources of generating revenue for communities
in South Africa today. Ecotourism has been an effective method of resource management in
generating viable economic development in rural South African Communities. Ecotourism
concentrates on conserving the environment while at the same time assisting in sustaining the best
interests of local people. Ecosystem services include, but are not limited to, fuelwood, medicinal
plants, river sand and industrial timber, provide rural employment and cash income through sales.
In investigating the total projected revenue generation of both practices, I have concluded that by
combining the two methods South African rural communities can ensure economic diversity and
economic, social, political and psychological empowerment.</para>
