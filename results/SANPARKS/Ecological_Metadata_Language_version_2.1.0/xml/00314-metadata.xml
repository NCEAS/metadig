 <abstract><para>African savannas are shaped by the interaction of two ecological factors: African
elephants (Loxodonta africana) and fires. The response of individual Acacias to
megaherbivores and fire regimes is dependent on their life history strategies. The
resulting architecture of trees is a trade-off between a strategy of growing tall to escape
low-lying fires or of developing thick, insulating bark to protect the internal structure
from heat damage. Allometric studies suggest that there is a strong relationship between
trunk diameter and average bark thickness, as well as trunk diameter and height, in
Acacia nigrescens and Acacia tortilis. When both have similar bark thicknesses, A.
nigrescens tends to grow taller and burn at higher temperatures than A. tortilis. The
combination of bark stripping and field burns show that elephants can have dramatic
effects on the survival abilities of trees during fires and that Acacias have varied life
history strategies in response. Severely debarked (over 50%) A. nigrescens have greater
odds of experiencing interruptions in the water column, as reflected in increased leaf
discoloration and wilting, whereas A. tortilis shows no effect within the same time period.
This suggests that A. nigrescens copes with fire and megafaunal herbivory by increasing
canopy height and A. tortilis copes by investing in bark with greater insular ability to
protect against fire and in mechanical defences to protect against herbivory.</para>

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><para>Mapungubwe National Park (S22.21850 E029.36489) is a xeric savanna with a diverse</para>
 <para>array of flora and fauna, situated in the Limpopo Province of South Africa on the borders</para>
 <para>of Botswana and Zimbabwe. Our experiment took place over the span of six days from</para>
 <para>13-18 November 2006. We burned and collected tree samples from four sites around</para>
 <para>Leokwe Camp in Mapungubwe National Park.</para>
 <para>Study Species</para>
 <para>We performed our allometry study, field burn experiment and burn temperature study</para>
 <para>on Acacia nigrescens and Acacia tortilis. A. nigrescens occurs from KwaZulu-Natal in</para>
 <para>South Africa northward into central Africa (Schmidt et al. 2002). In response to</para>
 <para>herbivory, A. nigrescens has both mechanical and chemical defense. The bark of A.</para>
 <para>nigrescens is covered with thorn-tipped knobs and rich with tannin. Similarly, A. tortilis</para>
 <para>is widespread throughout the bushveld biomes of South Africa with distribution ranging</para>
 <para>from the Northern Cape northward to the Limpopo Province and westward to</para>
 <para>Mpumalanga (Schmidt et al. 2002). A. tortilis is characterized by a combination of</para>
 <para>mechanical defenses manifested as hooks and thorns.</para>
 <para>Allometry</para>
 <para>Acacia tortilis versus Acacia nigrescens. Trunk diameter, average bark thickness and</para>
 <para>height data were taken from 27 A. nigrescens and 29 A. tortilis near the Leokwe camp.</para>
 <para>Individuals were chosen to represent a range of size classes. Trunk diameter was</para>
 <para>measured at 10 cm above ground. Three bark thickness measurements were taken after</para>
 <para>removing a small square of bark at this same height above ground. A clinometer was</para>
 <para>used to calculate height (see Appendix A). Log-transformed data were used in regression</para>
 <para>analyses to ensure comparability between species. Microsoft Excel was used to analyze</para>
 <para>the significance and strength of relationships between trunk diameter, average bark</para>
 <para>thickness and height.</para>
 <para>Acacia nigrescens in mesic versus xeric savannas. Allometric data of A. nigrescens</para>
 <para>from our study were compared to a similar study undertaken in Matiyani, Mpumalanga</para>
 <para>Province, in April 2006 (Bouley et al. unpublished). The Matiyani study measured 35 A.</para>
 <para>nigrescens for trunk diameter, bark thickness, and height with methods similar to our</para>
 <para>study.</para>
 <para>Field Burns</para>
 <para>Sample specimens of Acacia nigrescens and Acacia tortilis were burned on the</para>
 <para>second and third days of the experiment between the hours of 1000 and 1500. On both</para>
 <para>days, the temperature exceeded 35&#186;C with humidity less than 25%. Due to heavy rain on</para>
 <para>the first day of experimentation, trees were surveyed and debarked on the first day and</para>
 <para>then burned on the second and third days.</para>
 <para>Field burns were implemented using the wick-fire technique (Uhl and Kauffman,</para>
 <para>1990). A paraffin-soaked cotton rope was wrapped three times around the trunk and</para>
 <para>ignited. All burns were standardized to four minutes. The fires died after roughly two</para>
 <para>138</para>
 <para>minutes and were relit with a fresh paraffin-soaked cord. Throughout the four minutes,</para>
 <para>the upper canopy was shielded from heat convection. The burned trees were assessed</para>
 <para>four days later for visible foliage damage in the form of leaf discoloration and leaf</para>
 <para>wilting. An approximate estimation of the percent of canopy cover affected was recorded</para>
 <para>as an indictor of the fire damage to the water column.</para>
 <para>For the burning experiments, we tested 100 trees in total: 50 A. nigrescens and 50 A.</para>
 <para>tortilis. Of the 50 samples, 20 were set aside as controls and the remaining 30 tree</para>
 <para>samples were allocated to test either the effects of fire on different stem diameter or the</para>
 <para>effects of fire on trees that were debarked.</para>
 <para>Burn simulations on different stem diameters. Fifteen samples of A. nigrescens and</para>
 <para>15 samples A. tortilis were burned to assess the effects of stem diameter on leaf</para>
 <para>discoloration and wilting. The samples of each species were evenly distributed amongst</para>
 <para>the three size classes: 20 mm, 25 mm and 30 mm. These samples were not subject to</para>
 <para>debarking and were burned as previously outlined.</para>
 <para>Effects of bark removal and burning. Twenty samples of A. nigrescens and 20</para>
 <para>samples of A. tortilis were treated to varying degrees of bark stripping: 0%, 25%, 50% or</para>
 <para>75%. The stem diameter on all samples was 25 mm. The five samples of 25 mm stems</para>
 <para>used in the stem diameter experiment were used as the 0% debarked samples. The stems</para>
 <para>were stripped in a segment of roughly three centimeters and wicks were wrapped under</para>
 <para>the area of debarking so that the flame would directly affect the area stripped. As a</para>
 <para>control, an additional 20 specimens of each Acacia sp. were debarked at 0%, 25%, 50%</para>
 <para>or 75% but not burned.</para>
