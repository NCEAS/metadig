 <abstract><para>We studied the effects of vegetation structure and composition on avian species,
assemblages, and diversity. The study was conducted over a period of five days in the
Mapungubwe National Park, South Africa. The two habitat types studied were open
wooded savanna and riparian forest. Ten test sites were chosen for vegetation and avian
sampling. Vegetation was sampled for visibility (at varying height levels), height profile,
species composition, tree density, and canopy cover. Avian data was collected for
species, abundance, and presence. This was done by monitoring 60m x 60m quadrants
for 10 minutes each. Birds in the quadrant were recorded for abundance, while birds
outside were recorded only for presence. Visual identification was used to identify birds
within the quadrant, while auditory calls and visual identification were used for presence
outside of the quadrant. Our analysis statistically reflected vegetation structure and
floristic composition to determine patterns that influence avian composition rather than
species diversity. Changes in structural complexity and floristic diversity do not relate to
either losses or gains in avian species diversity, but do relate to a turnover in species
within the communities. Increased vegetation canopy cover correlated with increased
species diversity. Floristic composition appears to display the most valuable evidence of
determining the bird species assembled in each habitat, although we do not undermine the
importance of vegetation structure at the same level.</para>

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><para>Our study was conducted in Mapungubwe national park, located in the Limpopo</para>
 <para>province of northern South Africa. We considered the site as being appropriate based on</para>
 <para>the fact that system engineers such as elephants have just been introduced. Therefore feel</para>
 <para>that Mapungubwe can serve as base line biodiversity and ecological disturbance studies</para>
 <para>for KNP and other reserves that might have similar challenges. The park encompasses a</para>
 <para>dramatically varying environment. Much of the park is dry open woodland or shrub</para>
 <para>savanna, but along the edges of the Limpopo and Sashe rivers are mature riparian forests.</para>
 <para>We conducted a series of surveys in 10 different sites; 5 in open wooded-savanna and 5</para>
 <para>in riparian woodland. Each site consisted of three count plots .The sites were selected</para>
 <para>based on obvious differences in vegetation structure and composition.</para>

 <para>Avian surveys</para>
 <para>Our procedure involved three observers walking 60m x 60m quadrants for 10 minute</para>
 <para>increments. Each site consisted of 3 quadrants. Surveys were conducted in the early</para>
 <para>morning and late afternoon each day, from 05h00 to 08h30 and 16h00 to 18h30</para>
 <para>respectively, on the days of 13 November 2006 to 18. November 2006. Each site was</para>
 <para>surveyed twice, once in the morning and once in the evening, for a total of 6 quadrant</para>
 <para>surveys. Avian species abundance and presence were recorded for each of the 10 sites by</para>
 <para>combining the three morning surveys and the three evening surveys. Species identified</para>
 <para>visually within the quadrant as perching were scored for abundance, whereas species</para>
 <para>outside or flying threw the quadrant, identified visually or from calls, were recorded</para>
 <para>solely for presence, not abundance.</para>
 <para>Vegetation surveys</para>
 <para>In both vegetation types, we sampled vegetation variables that might explain the bird</para>
 <para>composition, namely horizontal visibility strata, height profile, species composition, tree</para>
 <para>density and canopy cover. A vegetation biomass profile was conducted at the heights of</para>
 <para>25cm, 50cm, 100cm, 150cm, 200cm, and 300cm from ground level. The involves</para>
 <para>quantifying the visibility at each height increment. An observer would place their head at</para>
 <para>a horizontal aspect congruent with the respective height increments whilst another,</para>
 <para>holding a white rectangular board at the same height above the ground, would move</para>
 <para>away from the observer until half of the board had disappeared behind obstructing</para>
 <para>vegetation. The distance between the observer and the other individual was recorded. The</para>
 <para>value recorded indicates the visible distance without significant obstruction by</para>
 <para>vegetation. The value was inverted to give a surrogate measure of what the respective</para>
 <para>biomass of vegetation was at each height increment (hence, the opposite measure to</para>
 <para>visibility; the distance that cannot be seen due to obstruction). Ten visibility recordings</para>
 <para>were conducted at each site at each height level. An S-score was calculated to represent</para>
 <para>each sites&#8217; vegetation profile in a single figure. The S-score is essentially an index</para>
 <para>calculated by the division of the mean at each height increment by the sum of the means</para>
 <para>of all height levels. This proportion is then squared and the S-score is the sum of all the</para>
 <para>products at each level.</para>
 <para>Three 50m transects were conducted at each site, measuring canopy density, canopy</para>
 <para>height and floristic composition. Using a densitometer, canopy density was taken at 5m</para>
 <para>intervals along each transect. Canopy height was determined by estimating tree height</para>
 <para>for individuals within 1m to either side of transect. Thus the flora species were recorded</para>
 <para>for an area of 100m&#178; for each transect.</para>
 <para>Statistical analyses:</para>
 <para>Our data was analysed using STATISTICA&#169; 6-software program and primer</para>
 <para>program. For data, which came from a population that did not assume normal</para>
 <para>distribution and equal variance, non-parametric test were performed to compare the</para>
 <para>differences between variables. The non-parametric tests we conducted were the Mann-</para>
 <para>Whitney and Krustal Wallis tests. Parametric were used to test samples which assumed</para>
 <para>normal distribution in comparing differences between tested variables. In testing for</para>
 <para>97</para>
 <para>nominal data and proportions, we used Chi-squared. Primer &#169; was used as an analysing</para>
 <para>tool for assemblages and examination of avian species distributions.</para>
