 <abstract><para>The allometric patterns of an insect body are shaped by an insect&#8217;s functional
ecology. In particular, we believe that different guilds of dung beetles practicing
different life history strategies will exhibit varying flight accuracy. We hypothesized
that these constraints would result in accurate flyers displaying generally lower wing
aspect ratios. Additionally, we expected to see a positive correlation between body
size and aspect ratio, signifying a decline in flight accuracy with increasing body size.
To capture and differentiate between inaccurate and accurate flying insects, we used a
modified pitfall trap, entitled the Byrne Pitfall Trap. The aspect ratios of the insects
collected in the inner and outer traps were not significantly different and did not
support our predicted correlation between body size and aspect ratio. These results
may not be representative of actual allometric patterns in insects due to our small
sample size. They nonetheless indicate that, for an insect, functional ecology and the
demands of flight have no bearing upon wing shape.</para>

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><para>Our experiment was conducted at De Hoop Nature reserve in South Africa&#8217;s</para>
 <para>Western Cape from October 27-29, 2006. The reserve, situated on the coast of the</para>
 <para>Indian Ocean, is dominated by the fynbos vegetation. We set our pitfall traps on the</para>
 <para>southern side of the road in an area of the reserve that is known to be frequented by</para>
 <para>several large ungulates, such as bontebok and eland. We hypothesized that the higher</para>
 <para>concentrations of ungulates in this area would correspond to more dung and thus more</para>
 <para>dung beetles.</para>
 <para>Materials</para>
 <para>To construct our pitfall traps, we dug ten holes and placed a large bucket in</para>
 <para>each hole with a smaller bucket in the inside. The outer buckets were intended to</para>
 <para>catch the hypothetically inaccurate flyers, insects that land at some distance from the</para>
 <para>bait and walk towards it, falling over the rim. We placed a smaller trap in the center of</para>
 <para>the large bucket to catch accurate flyers, the insects that fly directly onto the bait.</para>
 <para>Inner traps were bated with bovine dung wrapped in gauze and placed on a wire</para>
 <para>holder in the center. Since no part of the inner bucket touched the rim of the outer</para>
 <para>bucket, insects could not walk into the inner bucket; they could only land in the inner</para>
 <para>bucket if they flew directly onto it.</para>
 <para>Collection Technique</para>
 <para>We checked our traps twice each day, at 7:00 and 18:00, for three days. To</para>
 <para>collect the insects we poured the water from the inner bottle trap through a strainer</para>
 <para>and collected the insects from the strainer. The outer buckets actually consisted of</para>
 <para>two nested buckets, the lower to hold the shape of the hole in the ground, and the</para>
 <para>upper to be pulled out and strained. Each time we collected the insects from the traps,</para>
 <para>we re-baited the trap with fresh dung. The soapy water was usually reused after</para>
 <para>sieving, though occasionally replaced if particularly dirty.</para>
 <para>Additionally, we collected several specimens at a variety of random locations</para>
 <para>within the reserve. We labeled these as &#8220;general&#8221; insects and identified their family</para>
 <para>and functional ecology. The majority of these specimens were identified as generalist</para>
 <para>plant feeders and presumed to be inaccurate flyers (pers. Comm. Marcus Byrne). We</para>
 <para>separated the insects into three categories: the &#8220;accurate&#8221; insects collected in the inner</para>
 <para>trap, the &#8220;inaccurate&#8221; insects collected in the outer bucket, and the general collection</para>
 <para>insects.</para>
 <para>Wing Analysis</para>
 <para>After each collection, we made measurements of the body size and the wing</para>
 <para>size of the specimens. To examine wing size, we removed the insect&#8217;s elytra, the hard</para>
 <para>outer covering of the wings characteristic of beetles, if present, and removed its</para>
 <para>wings. We placed the wings in drops of water on microscope slides and carefully</para>
 <para>unfolded them. Using a microscope under constant magnification, we measured the</para>
 <para>length and chord of each wing. We averaged the values from the insect&#8217;s two wings</para>
 <para>and divided the average length by the average width to obtain a value for the insect&#8217;s</para>
 <para>wing aspect ratio. Body size was determined by measuring the width of the</para>
 <para>24</para>
 <para>specimen&#8217;s pronotum, the middle segment of the insect body. Pronotum width scales</para>
 <para>isometrically with body length in insects and is therefore a good measure of overall</para>
 <para>body size (Kelly unpublished data).</para>
 <para>Statistical Analysis</para>
 <para>We calculated our statistics using Statistica 7.0 (StatSoft Inc. 2004). We used</para>
 <para>parametric tests (Anova, T Test, and the Tukey&#8217;s Post-Hoc test) to analyze</para>
 <para>relationships between collection locations within the trap and wing aspect ratios. The</para>
 <para>analyses were considered significant if the p-value was less than 0.05.</para>
