 <abstract><para>Approximately thirty species of frogs are found in the Kruger National Park. Throughout
the park there are three distinguishable types of pans - permanent, semi-permanent, and
temporary, which vary substantially in different areas, creating patches that are dynamic
in space and time. There are also different zones in the pans where distinct frog species
choose to dwell. The purpose of this study was to examine the species composition of
frogs in and around pans in three areas of the Kruger National Park; the Skukuza area, the
Shingwedzi area, and the Punda Maria area. We also looked at the different species of
frogs found in the different zones of the pan. We went out after sunset at each of the
three sites and captured the frogs after noting their behavior and where they were calling
from. In Skukuza, we caught seven species of frogs and identified the calls of two
additional species, in Shingwedzi we caught four species of frogs and identified the calls
of five additional species, and in Punda Maria we caught two species of frogs. We found
that the three main factors affecting species diversity in Kruger National Park were pan
type and size, location in KNP, and weather patterns (both long term and daily
fluctuations).</para>

 <para>Park. We performed our study in Skukuza on 14 February 2004, in Shingwedzi on 4 March 2004 and in</para>
 <para>Punda Maria on 24 March 2004. On all three occasions, we went frogging after sunset at approximately</para>
 <para>20h00. We listened attentively to the calls of the frogs, and if we were able to spot them with our torches,</para>
 <para>they were collected into bags. We recorded behavior of the frogs, and where they were located at the time</para>
 <para>of capture. We then put the frogs into plastic containers and brought them back to our research lab for</para>
 <para>species identification. In order to identify the frogs, we examined five characteristics. The first</para>
 <para>characteristic was locality&#8212;whether or not a certain species was found in the Kruger National Park.</para>
 <para>Secondly, we examined the frogs size and distinguishing characteristics. We made sure not to distinguish</para>
 <para>based on color because there is great color variance within single species. The next characteristic was</para>
 <para>habitat, more specifically, which zone of the pan the frog was found in. Finally, we matched the mating</para>
 <para>call with recorded calls (Carruthers 2001). All frogs were released the following day. During all frogging</para>
 <para>sessions, we also recorded species present in the pans based on identification of their calls, even if these</para>
 <para>species were not collected.</para>
