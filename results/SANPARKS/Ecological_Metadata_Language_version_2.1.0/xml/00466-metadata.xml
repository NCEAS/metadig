 <abstract><para>Ficus abutilifolia and Ficus tettensis are two species of deciduous rock fig trees commonly found on the vertical faces of Mapungubwe National Park, South Africa. The demographics of the rock figs as well as the habitat features necessary for successful maturation are currently unknown. This study first aims to provide demographic data and determine the points in the fig life cycle where bottlenecks occur. Secondly, it probes the importance to growth of location and usage of cracks. From general observations, we hypothesized that seedlings would be located anywhere on the rock faces, but that larger trees would be more limited to specific areas. We also conjectured that usage of cracks by tree roots would positively correlate with tree height, due to stability and nutrient gathering arguments. Within the sampled population, there was an uneven distribution of seedlings (62.8%), saplings (21.9%) and adults (15.3%). All size classes were contagiously dispersed on the outer edges of the rock faces, despite our expectation about seedling dispersal. Lastly, the number of cracks used by the roots as well as the number of large cracks used showed some degree of positive correlation with tree height. These results suggest that (1) there are growth bottlenecks in the population, (2) the outer edges of rock faces are either popular for dispersal or essential for establishment, and (3) large cracks provide more stability and/or necessary nutrients for trees as they mature.</para>

 <para>Study site</para>
 <para>From September 14th to September 15th, (sampling times ranged between 6:30 AM and 5:30 PM) we collected data within MNP in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. MNP is located in the northeastern region of South Africa in the confluence of the Shashi and Limpopo rivers. Within the national park we visited five sites (1, S22&#186;13.161 E029&#186;21.904; 2, S22&#186; 13.142 E029&#186; 21. 971; 3, S22&#186; 13.023 E029&#186;21.692; 4, S22&#186;12.313 E029&#186;22.289; 5, S22&#61616;11.33 E029&#61616;14.20). The sites are mainly cracked sandstone cliff faces surrounding dry valleys.</para>
 <para>Within these five sites we sampled from 26 rock faces. We defined separate rock faces as being bounded by the top and bottom of the cliff face and by any vertical edges or large fissures. We then broke the face into three concentric zones with perimeters equidistant from each other (Fig. 1). In total, we sampled 137 individuals, four of which were dead.</para>

 <para>Study species</para>
 <para>We focused on the broad-leaved rock figs Ficus abutilifolia&#8212;the large-leaved rock fig&#8212;and Ficus tettensis&#8212;the small-leaved rock fig. The two species differ in leaf characteristics but are both rock-splitters and are usually found in the same areas (Burrows and Burrows 2003). Since these trees are nearly biologically equivalent, we decided to combine the data of each species.</para>
 <para>Data collection</para>
 <para>We first measured tree height (from the base of the trunk to the tallest branch), which allowed us to determine the population structure and height bottlenecks. To collect these measurements we used a hypsometer (Nikon) for the trees that had non-angled trunks. We measured trees with angled trunks using estimations calibrated by the hypsometer measurements. After measuring the height of a tree, we classified it as being a seedling, sapling, or adult, with seedlings being 0-0.5m tall, saplings being &gt;0.5-1.5m tall, and adults being &gt;1.5m tall. For each tree we noted the zone in which it resided in order to test our hypothesis about the effect of zone on tree height. We then estimated the distance between it and its nearest neighbor of the same size class so that we would be able to determine the dispersal pattern on the rock face.</para>
 <para>Lastly, we counted the cracks within a one-meter radius of each individual and sorted them into three categories based on width: small (0-2cm), medium (2-7cm) and large (&gt;7cm). We counted how many cracks were occupied by the roots and how many were unused.</para>
 <para>Data analyses</para>
 <para>We organized our data and performed regressions using Microsoft Excel software (Microsoft 2003). In order to assess size-based bottlenecks, we first ranked all individuals from shortest to tallest and observed significant shifts in population structure.</para>
 <para>Using the nearest neighbor distances, we calculated dispersal indices to determine whether each size class was normally, randomly, or contagiously dispersed (Fowler et al 1998). Using tree heights and the data collected on tree location zone, we calculated the probability of finding an individual of a specific size class in a specific zone on each rock face. These probabilities were not normally distributed. We thus ran nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests using Statistica, v. 6, software (StatSoft 2004) in order to determine (1) whether each size class was significantly more likely to be found in a particular zone and (2) whether any class was more likely to be found in zone 3 than other size classes.</para>
 <para>In order to quantify total crack usage we created a crack index score for each tree. We summed all used cracks, giving small cracks a value of one, medium cracks a value of two, and large cracks a value of three. For example, a tree using two large cracks, one medium crack, and three small cracks received a crack index score of 11 (2*3 + 1*2 + 3*1=11). We regressed this index against tree heights. This regression illustrated the general importance of cracks in the maturation of rock figs. However, it didn&#8217;t specify whether the size of cracks is important. Therefore, in three separate analyses we regressed the number of small, medium, and large cracks used against tree heights. Regression results revealed any causal relationships between the compared variables. We excluded trees that we observed to be growing directly out of a soil patch in all of these crack use regressions, due to the possibility of this reducing dependence on root growth for nutrient gathering.</para>
