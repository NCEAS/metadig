Despite several qualitative reviews of many individual empirical studies, there has been little quantitative synthesis examining the generality of context dependency, or conditions that may promote it. We conducted a meta-analysis of ant-plant protection mutualisms to examine the generality of context dependent effects of ants on herbivory and plant performance (growth, reproduction). Our results show that ant effects on plants are not generally context dependent, but instead are routinely positive and rarely neutral, as overall effect sizes of ants in reducing herbivory and increasing plant performance were positive and significantly greater than zero. The magnitude of these positive effects did vary, however. Variation in plant performance was not explained by the type of biotic or abiotic factor examined, including plant rewards (extrafloral nectar, food bodies, domatia), ant species richness, plant growth form, or latitude. With the exception of plant growth form, these factors did contribute to the effects of ants in reducing herbivory. Reductions in herbivory were greater for plants with than without domatia, and greatest for plants with both domatia and food bodies. Effect sizes of ants in reducing herbivory decreased, but remained positive, with latitude and ant species richness. Effect sizes in reducing herbivory were greater in tropical versus temperate systems. Although ant-plant interactions have been pivotal in the study of context dependency of mutualisms, our results, along with other recent meta-analyses, indicate that context dependency may not be a general feature of mutualistic interactions. Rather, ant-plant protection mutualisms appear to be routinely positive for plants, and only occasionally neutral.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword keywordType="theme">meta-analysis</keyword><keyword keywordType="taxonomic">ant-plant</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">protection</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">mutualism</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">context dependent</keyword><keywordThesaurus>None</keywordThesaurus></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>other</para><para>cite the data set in publications</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><offline><mediumName>digital</mediumName></offline></distribution><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><singleDateTime><calendarDate>2008</calendarDate></singleDateTime></temporalCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>All continents except Antarctica</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-76.5000</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>149.5000</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>42.3997</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>-35.6333</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><taxonomicCoverage scope="document"><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Family</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>Formicidae</taxonRankValue></taxonomicClassification><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Kingdom</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>Plantae</taxonRankValue></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Scott</givenName><surName>Chamberlain</surName></individualName><organizationName>Rice University</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>6100 Main Street

We included studies that performed ant exclusion experiments (ants removed or prevented from accessing plants) and those that used the natural presence and absence of ants on plants. We assigned each study to one or both of two plant responses: herbivore damage and herbivore density (hereafter, herbivory), and plant growth and reproduction (hereafter, plant performance). For both herbivory and plant performance, we used mean values for records that were not independent (e.g., different years, populations, study sites, or multiple measures of the same response variable). We included each plant species when more than one was reported within a single paper. We combined records among studies of the same plant species. Importantly, we only incorporated studies into our data set that reported error estimates along with mean values. The data set includes 76 studies, representing 64 plant species in 28 families.</para></section></description></methodStep><sampling><studyExtent><description><para>Taxonomic coverage of data: Ants (Order Hymenoptera, Family Formicidae) and plants (Kingdom Plantae) were the only taxa studied in this dataset. The presence/absence of ants on plants in general were manipulated. Thus there is no specific taxonomic information given.
