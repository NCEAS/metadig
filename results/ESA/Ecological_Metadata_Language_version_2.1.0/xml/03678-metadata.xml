<title>Methods</title>
<para>Rainwater collection:

We installed three collectors (high-density polyethylene [HDPE] funnels 2 m off the ground, connected via silicone and Teflon tubing to dark HDPE bottles on the ground) for event-based bulk deposition sampling at open sites less than 800 m from the 7-, 12 000-, and 120 000-yr-old sites. Many of the nine sites are very close to one another, so three collectors were sufficient. No particles were found in collectors. We collected samples in winter (July and August) and summer (November and December), immediately filtering them to 45 um and keeping them frozen from &lt;6 h after collection until chemical analysis at Princeton. All materials were acid washed and/or thoroughly leached and were clean when tested for N contamination.</para>
<para>Rainwater N chemistry and fluxes:

To analyze rainwater we used Alpkem colorimetry (OI Analytical, College Station, Texas, USA) for NH4-N, Dionex ion chromatography (Bannockburn, Illinois, USA) for NO3-N, and Shimadzu 5 000 (Tokyo, Japan) 850C platinum catalyst combustion for total dissolved N concentration ([TDN]). For methods details see Hedin et al. (2003). Total dissolved N concentration did not vary with event volume, season, or site, so we multiplied our global mean [TDN] by estimated annual rainfall at each collector site (Richardson et al. 2004) to estimate input fluxes. For sites lacking collectors, we used values from the climatically and spatially closest sites: the 7-yr old site data for sites &lt;=5000 yr old, 12 000-yr-old site data for that site only, and 120 000-yr-old site data for sites &lt;=60 000 yr old.</para>
<para>Biological N fixation sample collection:

When possible, samples were collected along randomly spaced and oriented transects. Otherwise (for rare types), samples were arbitrarily chosen from those available. Coriaria nodules were collected with &gt;2 cm root tissue attached to allow carbon flow during incubation. Full depth profiles (on ground or epiphytic surface) of lichen, bryophyte, and litter samples of known area (typically 25 cm2) were collected. These samples were not chosen for specific species, so in addition to the common species listed in the site description, many other species are represented in our acetylene reduction assay (ARA) and density sampling. Epiphytic samples were collected from &lt;4 m height. Samples were weighed after incubation, then dried and weighed again for water content.</para>
<para>Nitrogenase activity rates:

Nitrogenase activity rates were determined using the acetylene reduction assay (Hardy et al. 1968), which uses the fact that nitrogenase reduces acetylene (C2H2) to ethylene (C2H4). Within minutes of collection, samples were incubated at atmospheric pressure with 90% ambient air and 10% welding-grade C2H2 (BOC Gases, Auckland, New Zealand) in gas-tight, transparent half-pint canning jars, which were placed upside-down on the forest floor to simulate ambient light and temperature. Incubation periods were 30 min for Coriaria nodules and 24 h for other types, which were the minimum times needed to detect [C2H4] changes in winter; ARA was approximately linear over these timescales. Acetylene and sample blanks were used to correct for C2H4 contamination. Homogenized gas samples were stored in evacuated glass vials for fewer than seven days before [C2H4] analysis on an SRI 8610 gas chromatograph (SRI Instruments, Torrance, California, USA), using a Porapak N column (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, Illinois, USA), &gt;=99.99% He as a carrier, and &gt;=99.99% H2 combined with breathing air (BOC Gases) for combustion in the flame-ionization detector. Activity rates are expressed as micromoles C2H4 produced per hour of incubation time per gram of dry sample for nodules or nanomoles C2H4 per hour per square centimeter sample for other types. The minimum
detection limit (MDL) was 0.024 nmol C2H4/cm2/h. Preliminary sampling showed that other sources thought to be important elsewhere (decomposing wood and epiphylls, e.g., Matzek and Vitousek 2003) were negligible sources of BNF here.</para>
<para>Nitrogen fixer densities:

We massed all dry Coriaria nodules found in 10 400-cm2, &gt;=15 cm deep soil pits in each subplot. In each subplot, pits were evenly spaced along a randomly oriented pair of perpendicular transects. Nodule density estimates are conservative, as there may have been deeper nodules. To scale BNF rates by Coriaria density, we measured the circumference (at the base in the 7-yr-old site and at breast height in the 60-yr-old site) of each Coriaria stem. Lichen densities were estimated by calibrated visual counts of lichen area (epiphytic and on the ground) divided by the ground area of each subplot. Bryophyte densities were estimated by percent cover of bryophytes on the ground and on each tree (multiplied by tree surface area) in each subplot. We estimated tree surface area by assuming trees are cylinders, multiplying circumference by height. Epiphytic estimates are lower bounds because we could not see high in the canopy (or on top of branches) and because our estimated allometries yield unrealistically low surface areas. Litter density was estimated by percent cover of litter on the ground.</para>
<para>Acetylene reduction to BNF conversion:

We calibrated ARA to BNF using 15N2 gas, conducting paired, simultaneous assays on fresh nodules, lichens, and bryophytes with C2H2 and 15N2 in the field. Nodules were assayed for 1 h with 10% 15N2 (&gt;=98 atom %; Isotec, Miamisburg, Ohio, USA), lichens for 24 h with 10% 15N2, and bryophytes for 24 h with 50% 15N2. Litter was not calibrated because the incubation time necessary (&gt;100 h) was beyond the range of linearity. Since our only data on free-living N fixers come from bryophytes, we used bryophyte conversion factors (CFs) to calibrate litter BNF. For 15N2 assays we replaced the desired amount of gas with a mixture of 15N2 (80%) and O2 (20%). Incubations were terminated in the field by evacuating each jar (to &gt;25 in Hg). Samples were removed from their vacuum at the field station, dried at 60C, and stored dry until ground by roller mill or mortar and pestle. Ground, homogenized samples were analyzed for 15N/14N and percentage of N at the Boston University Stable Isotope Laboratory, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. The molar CF of ARA to BNF was calculated as (micromoles of C2H4 produced per hour per gram dry mass [DM] or square centimeter) divided by (micromoles N incorporated per hour per gram DM or square centimeter) divided by 2. All sampling took place between July 2004 and December 2005.</para>
<para>Biological nitrogen fixation input fluxes:

For each season and each type of N fixer, BNF input fluxes were calculated as the product of ARA (in micromoles of C2H4 per hour per gram DM or square centimeter sample), density (in gram DM or square centimeter sample per square meter of ground), the reciprocal of the CF (in micromoles of C2H4 per micromole of N2), and a unit conversion constant. For annual fluxes we assumed that summer and winter rates each occur for half the year.</para>
<para>Statistics:

We used a maximum likelihood (ML) approach to analyze our data for three main reasons. First, because BNF is a product of three measured quantities (ARA, N fixer density, and CF), the estimated BNF inputs should incorporate error from all three sources. This error propagation, and the construction of confidence intervals that accompanies it, is not possible with classical statistics, but it is with ML. Second, some of our data were below the MDL of our analytical equipment. Traditional methods of dealing with this issue (such as treating all data points below the MDL as one-half the MDL) are inadequate, and ML allows a better treatment. Third, classical parametric statistics require certain assumptions (such as normality and homoscedasticity) that did not always fit our data, and ML is much more flexible in its assumptions. For example, ML allows variations on traditional tests, such as an ANOVA with non-normally distributed residuals (Hilborn and Mangel 1997). Our general statistical model assumes that each observation at site j and subplot i, Oij, is given by a function of the independent variables (IVs), f (IV), a random site effect, ej, and a random subplot effect, ci
[Oij =  f(IV) + ej + ci]. The site and subplot effects are given by the probability distributions P(ej) and D(ci), which could be normal, gamma, or any other continuous distribution. The likelihood of a data set {O1 . . . ON} (with N data, indexed by k) given a model M is
[SEE PAPER]
where M describes the unique combination of the
function f (IV) and the probability distributions P(ej) and D(ci) (and their parameters). The second case in Eq. 2 is for a datum below the MDL. In this case we do not know its true value, but we do know its likelihood (given the model M): the area under the probability density function up to the MDL.

The maximum likelihood is the global peak of Eq. 2 as
a function of the model parameters, which we found on
a computer with a peak-finding algorithm (simulated
annealing) that reliably finds global maxima (Goffe et al. 1994). To determine which model fit best, e.g., whether a saturating increase in ARA as a function of soil age was better than a linear increase or no change with soil age, we compared many models against each other using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). More complicated models (those with more parameters) yield a higher maximum likelihood, but do not necessarily give better predictive power. The AIC balances this trade-off by assigning a penalty to each free parameter in the model. For confidence intervals (CIs) and error propagation, we again used simulated annealing to find the values that corresponded to half the v2 value for the number of free parameters (Hilborn and Mangel 1997). We present 68% CIs, which roughly correspond to the standard error (SE).

For density data, either soil age or soil inorganic N is the only IV, whereas for ARA, season (winter or summer) is also an IV. Our analysis of BNF inputs incorporates uncertainty from ARA, density, and CF data, and all BNF data are presented as means with 68% CIs. For bulk deposition data we used collector number (1, 2, or 3) and season as IVs and present the exact SE. Details of each analysis and additional explanations are in Appendix A.</para>
