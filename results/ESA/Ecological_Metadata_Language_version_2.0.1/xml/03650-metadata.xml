 <abstract><para>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) assessed the ecological condition of estuaries, bays, and tidal rivers in the Virginian Biogeographic Province (Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to Cape Henry, Virginia) during July - September 1990 - 1993. Indicators measured at 425 probability-based stations included water quality (temperature, salinity, clarity, dissolved oxygen), contamination and toxicity of sediment, structure of benthic and fish communities, and gross external pathology of fishes. These data were used to quantify the condition of ecological resources in the entire province, as well as in three subgroups (small estuaries, large estuaries, major tidal rivers). Also characterized was the condition of ecological resources for four major estuarine systems within the province (Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, Hudson - Raritan system, Long Island Sound) and three tidal rivers in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (Potomac, Rappahannock, James). The data provide an unbiased baseline estimate of estuarine conditions in this province in the early 1990s. They should be useful in assessing long-term and broadscale questions such as global climate change, biodiversity, and environmental impacts.</para>

<para>Estuaries were selected as one of the first resources to be sampled by EMAP. Estuaries are among the most productive of ecological systems, provide feeding, spawning, and nursery habitats, and are part of migratory routes for many commercially and recreationally important fish and wildlife, including threatened and endangered species. The public values estuarine ecosystems for recreation and aesthetic appeal. Estuaries are complex transition zones between streams, rivers, and coastal oceans. They have physical features that concentrate and retain pollutants, and they are repositories for the many pollutants released into the atmosphere and the nation's surface waters. The ecological condition of estuaries is influenced strongly by human activities in the watershed, particularly land use patterns and the release of pollutants to the environment. In many coastal regions, water and sediment quality and the abundance of living resources are perceived to have declined despite the implementation of pollution control programs.</para>
<para>Research methods: An important aspect of the EMAP Virginian Province project was that the data were collected and processed with consistent methods. Field methods are documented in the Field Operations and Safety Manual (Reifsteck et al. 1993). Laboratory methods are given in the EMAP-Estuaries Laboratory Methods Manual (USEPA 1995). A performance-based approach was used for chemical analyses, consistent with the approach used by the NOAA National Status &amp;nds Program (Valette-Silver 1992). All sampling was conducted from small (24-ft) vessels, except for fish sampling at deep-water stations (greater than 25m), which were collected from larger vessels.</para>
<para>a. Field/laboratory: Water column profiles for water quality parameters were collected using a SeaBird SBE-25 Sea Logger CTD. The unit was equipped with probes to measure salinity, temperature, depth, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), light transmission, fluorescence, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Water quality measurements were collected upon arrival at a sampling station; no effort was made to standardize for the time of day or stage of tide. The CTD was equilibrated at the sea surface, then lowered through the water column until reaching a depth of one meter above the bottom where the CTD was allowed to equilibrate again. The unit was then returned to the surface, where data were downloaded to an on-board computer for review and storage. If the CTD cast appeared unusual or failed quality control criteria, the cast was repeated. Beginning in 1991, a bottom water sample was collected, and the dissolved oxygen concentration determined with a YSI Model 58 DO meter. This measurement served as a check on the CTD probe as well as a back-up in case the CTD failed.</para>
<para>Three benthic samples, if possible, were collected using a stainless steel, Young-modified van Veen grab that sampled a surface area of 440 cm2. A small core (2-cm diameter) was collected from each grab for sediment grain size. The remaining sample was sieved through a 0.5-mm screen using a backwash technique that minimized damage to soft-bodied animals. Samples were preserved in 10% formalin-rose bengal solution and stored for at least 30 days prior to processing to assure proper fixation. In the laboratory, macrobenthic community samples were transferred from formalin to an ethanol solution and sorted. Biomass was measured for key taxa and all other taxa were grouped according to taxonomic type.</para>
<para>Fish were collected by trawling with a 15-m, high-rise otter trawl with a 2.5-cm mesh cod end. The net was towed for 10 minutes against the tide between 0.5 and 1.5 m/s (1 - 3 knots). All fish caught in the trawl were identified to species and counted; up to 30 individuals of a species from each collection were measured to the nearest millimeter. Individuals collected in standard trawls were inspected for gross external pathological disorders at all stations where fish were collected. This included checking body surface and fins for lumps, growths, ulcers, and fin erosion. Specimens with observed gross pathologies were preserved in Dietrich's solution for subsequent laboratory verification and histological examination.</para>
<para>An additional 6 - 10 sediment grabs at each station were taken for sediment chemistry and toxicity analyses. The top 2 cm of sediment was removed from each grab using a stainless steel spoon and thoroughly homogenized in a stainless steel pot. Sediment for chemistry analyses was placed in clean glass jars with Teflon liners or polypropylene containers (for organic and metals analyses, respectively), shipped on ice, and stored frozen in the laboratory prior to analysis for contaminants. Sediments were analyzed for 24 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 18 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, DDTs, 11 chlorinated pesticides, butyl tins, and 15 metals. The chemical analyte list is the same as used in the NOAA N S &amp;T Program (NOAA 1992). An additional aliquot was placed in a small polyethylene bag and refrigerated for grain size analysis. The remainder of the composite sample (greater than 3,000 mL) was placed in a clean plastic jar for sediment toxicity testing.</para>
<para>Toxicity tests were performed on the composite sediment samples from each station using the standard 10-day acute test method (USEPA 1994, USEPA 1995) and the tube-dwelling amphipod Ampelisca abdita. Amphipods were exposed to sediment from the site for 10 d under static conditions in 1-L glass test chambers. Five replicates per station were tested with 20 amphipods per replicate. A performance control was run with each test, as was a water-only test using a reference toxicant (Cu or sodium dodecyl sulfate) to evaluate the condition of the test organisms. Eighty-five percent survival in the sediment control was required for a test to be valid. To normalize for test conditions and amphipod health, survival among treatments is expressed as percent of control survival.</para>

<sampling><studyExtent><description><para>EMAP identified boundaries for seven biogeographic provinces defined by NOAA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service using major climatic zones and prevailing ocean currents (Bailey 1983, Terrell 1979). The Virginian Province (which covers approximately 23,573 km^2 from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to the mouth of Chesapeake Bay at Cape Henry, Virginia, USA), was selected as the testing ground for the EMAP estuarine monitoring effort. Many estuaries in this Province have been investigated intensively and a considerable amount of information was available for designing the monitoring program. In addition, many management decisions were forthcoming, including development of a restoration plan for the New York Harbor complex and evaluating management plans for Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay, and Long Island Sound. This presented an opportunity to demonstrate how EMAP monitoring data could assist in the formulation of environmental programs and policies.

Estuaries were classified into three classes (or strata): large estuarine systems, small estuarine systems, and large tidal rivers (Holland 1990). Large estuarine systems are defined as systems having surface areas greater than 260 km^2 and aspect ratios (length/average width) less than 18. Twelve large estuarine systems with a total surface area of 16,097 km^2 or 68% of the Province's estuarine area met these criteria. Large tidal rivers, defined as systems having surface areas greater than 260 km^2 and aspect ratios greater than 18, included the Hudson, Potomac, James, Delaware, and Rappahannock Rivers. These five tidal rivers have a total surface area of 2,601 km^2 or 11% of the total Province area. Small estuarine systems are defined as systems having surface areas less than 260 km^2 but greater than or equal to 2.6 km^2 . There were 144 small estuarine systems with a total surface area of 4,875 km^2 or 21% of the Province.</para>

<samplingDescription><para>Sampling sites in the large estuarine class were selected using a randomly placed systematic grid (Holland 1990, Paul et al. 1992). The distance between the systematically spaced sampling points on the grid was approximately 18 km. The grid is an extension of the systematic EMAP grid (Overton et al. 1991). The center points of the grids are the sample sites. A linear analog of the systematic grid was used for site selection in the large tidal rivers (Holland 1990, Paul et al. 1992). The grid was used to define the spine of the five large tidal rivers, with a starting point at the river mouth. The first transect was randomly located between river kilometer 0 and 25. Additional transects were then placed every 25 km up the river to the head of tide. The 144 small estuarine systems were randomly selected from the entire list of small systems in the Province (Holland 1990, Paul et al. 1992). They were ordered from north to south by combining adjacent estuaries into groups of four. One estuary was selected randomly from each group without replacement for each of the four years of sampling. The location of the sample within each selected small system was randomly placed. Application of the sampling design to the three estuarine resource classes resulted in 446 potential sampling sites; however, 21 were unsampleable due to inadequate water depth or inaccessibility, so 425 sites were sampled over the four-year period.</para>
