<abstract><para>Experimental clearings in macroalgal  (Ascophyllum nodosum) stands were established in 1996 to determine if mussel beds and macroalgal stands on protected intertidal shores of New England represent alternative community states. Circular clearings 1, 2, 4, and 8 m in diameter were made in Ascophyllum stands at 12 sites on Swan's Island, Maine. Each site also had an uncleared control. The sites are nested within four bays. The purpose of this data set is to provide access to data on densities and percent cover in the 60 experimental plots from 1996 to 2002. Data include densities of mussels (Mytilus edulis and Modiolus modiolus), an herbivorous limpet (Tectura testudinalis), herbivorous snails (Littorina littorea, Littorina obtusata), a predatory snail (Nucella lapillus), a barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides), and fucoid algae (Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus), and percent cover by mussels, barnacles, and fucoids. Published analyses of the data set show that succession depends on clearing size and not on site-specific differences.</para>

 <methods> <methodStep> <description> <section> <title>Experimental design</title>
 <para>At each site, four circular experimental plots, which were 1, 2, 4, and 8 m in diameter clearings, and a control plot, which was not cleared, were established. It was not possible to make the clearings during the winter because of limited access and dangerous conditions due to snow and ice. Thus plots were originally scraped between 22 June and 17 August 1996 and then re-scraped between 6 and 10 February 1997 to mimic winter ice events. Scraping was done using paint scrapers and removed all A. nodosum. Center of plots were marked with two stainless steel reference bolts which were anchored in drilled holes. Plots were left unmanipulated thereafter. Plots within a site are separated by at least 10 m, and sites within bays by at least 750 m. The size range of the experimental clearings is within the normal range of major ice scour events, which occur infrequently on Swan's Island. For example, ice removed an average of 13% of the A. nodosum cover from the 12 experimental sites during the winter of 2002 - 2003 (range: 0 - 39%, P. S. Petraitis, unpublished data). At the three sites with the greatest damage, the average area of naturally created clearings was 25.4m &#178; (range: 2.4 - 78.5m &#178; , n = 5 clearings per site). The experimental clearings are 0.8 - 50.3m &#178;  in area</para>
 <para>Design characteristics: The experimental set-up is a partially nested design with clearing size fully crossed with bays and sites, and sites nested within bays. Sites and bays are considered random effects and clearing size is a fixed treatment effect. The design is fully discussed in Petraitis and Dudgeon (2004b).</para>
 <para>Data verification: Original data entries in Excel files are checked prior to calculation of averages. Averages are screened for outliers, which are then re-checked by comparing hand-written entries on original data books against entries in Excel files. Averages for percent cover are also checked to see if sum of understory species (barnacles, mussels, Fucus, and bare surface) sums to 100%.</para>

 <sampling> <studyExtent> <description> <para>Site type: The sites are in the mid intertidal zones of sheltered bays, and experimental clearings are between 0.3 and 1.0 m above Mean Low Water. 

Geography: Swans Island is located at 44&#176; 10' N, 68&#176; 25' W in the Gulf of Maine, USA. The island is approximately 36 km2 in area with a highly irregular coastline. 

Habitat: The mid intertidal shores are protected from wave surge and dominated by the rockweed A. nodosum. 

Geology: The shoreline surfaces at the different sites are a mixture of granite and basalt outcrops, boulder fields, and some muddy patches in the most protected sites.

Watersheds/hydrology: The exposure to waves at these sites ranges from extremely protected to moderately protected.</para>

 <samplingDescription> <para>Abundance and percent cover of the most common species have been sampled at least once a year since 1996. This data set contains data from summer 1996, spring and summer 1997, spring and summer 1998, summer 1999, spring and summer 2000, and summers of 2001 and 2002. Percent cover and densities were not sampled for all species on all dates. Uncleared control plots were not sampled in 1996. Spring samples are taken between mid-May and mid-June (median date: 15 June), and summer samples are taken between late June and mid August (median date: 7 July). 
Mussels (Mytilus edulis and Modiolus modiolus) and gastropods (Tectura testudinalis, Littorina littorea, Littorina obtusata and Nucella lapillus) were counted using five 50 x 50 cm quadrats per plot. Fucoid algae (Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus) were counted in the five 10 x 10 cm squares on the diagonal of each 50 x 50 cm quadrat because of the large number of recruits. The barnacle Semibalanus balanoides was counted in two 2 x 2 cm squares per 50 x 50 cm quadrat except in 1998 when one square per quadrat was used. Barnacle counts were divided into the current year's recruits and older individuals, which could be distinguished by differences in size and color.
Percent cover data were collected for fucoids, barnacles and mussels. Cover was estimated by counting the most common space occupier in the twenty-five 10 x 10 cm squares per 50 x 50 cm quadrat. Percent cover was thus calculated on the basis of 125 counts of presence/absence (25 squares per quadrat x 5 quadrats per plot). Ascophyllum nodosum was considered the normal canopy species and was counted first (range -100%) and then was pulled back to reveal the common understory species (Fucus vesiculosus, Semibalanus balanoides and Mytilus edulis), which were then counted. The category of "Bare" includes all other species, which were rare, and bare space. Understory species and bare space sums to 100%. Quadrats were grouped in the center of each clearing, and the sampling in the uncleared controls was done within 2 m of the reference bolts.</para>
