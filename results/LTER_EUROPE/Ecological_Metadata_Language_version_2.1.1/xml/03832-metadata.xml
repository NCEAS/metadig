<para>The method consists in the provision of fishing gear (creels) in homogeneously distributed environments in the sampling station. The number of creels to provide depend on each sampling station. In general, it will have as many creels as possible at a distance of not less than 5 meters between them, with a maximum of five. For the selected stations that relate later, creels are arranged in three groups of three creels each, separate creels in at least five meters and groups in at least 50 meters. Each group of creels is considered one unit of effort.Creels should be type "Shrimp" double death with mesh size of 4 mm., Sailing simple and approximate length of 3 m., 1:1 ratio between the candle and the body of the creel.Be placed on the ground, leaving part of the cod always above the water surface. The ring must be input, however, submerged as possible and at least the mouth must always be below the water surface. This arrangement minimizes the creelential effects on birds swimmers and decreases mortality of amphibians and reptiles caught in them.The review will take place between 12 and 24 hours of operation, and has remained at least one night on business.The provision on the ground will be supported on macoyas own vegetation or wetland or lake shore, using these elements to raise the cod and allow ventilation of creels.The withdrawal of the samples was made &#8203;&#8203;by nasa, scoring in each case the crab specimens caught mention of the following parameters: a) total length, b) carapace width (of the first 20 copies),c) carapace length (of the first 20 copies), d) sex, e) sexual stage (I or II) and f) specific comments. To each creel is measured weight crabs assembly contained therein by the use of a Pesola. When the sample obtained more than 100 copies will bypass the steps a, b, c, d and e in the copies of the creel after the one containing the copy number 100, it being necessary to measure the remaining copies of the creel in which it is located .Log the data on catches of other specimens of any species, even without specific protocol for them.</para>
