organic matter and biological properties. Substrate-induced respiration (SIR) inhibition was used to quantify microbial, fungal
and bacterial biomass in particle size fractions of soils ranging from forest to grassland in a subalpine region of central Taiwan.
In addition, ergosterol content was determined in the same samples to verify fungal biomass measured by SIR inhibition
technique. Surface soil (0&#8211;10 cm) was fractionated into four particle size fractions: coarse sand (250&#8211;2000 Am), fine sand (53&#8211;
250 Am), silt (2&#8211;53 Am) and clay (0.2&#8211;2 Am). The larger sized fractions (N250 Am and 53&#8211;250 Am) contained higher levels of
fungal ergosterol than the smaller sized ones (2&#8211;53 Am and 0.2&#8211;2 Am). The largest particle size fraction (250&#8211;2000 Am) from all
studied habitats showed the highest level of microbial biomass, with no clear trend in microbial biomass level among the other
size fractions. SIR-calculated fungal biomass level and ergosterol converted fungal biomass content were positively correlated
(r=0.71, pb0.05), and such correlation decreased as biomass levels were high. Ratios of fungi to bacteria ranged between 0.6
and 1.3 in fractions obtained in this study. This study indicates a high variability of microbial (fungal and bacterial) biomass
level among particle size fractions in soil, and that the large-sized fractions tend to contain a high level of microbial biomass in a
given ecosystem.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Bacterial</keyword></keywordSet><keywordSet><keyword>Ergosterol</keyword></keywordSet><keywordSet><keyword>Fungal</keyword></keywordSet><keywordSet><keyword>Respiration</keyword></keywordSet><keywordSet><keyword>Size fractions</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>If you want to use the information, please contact with me.</para></intellectualRights><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Tatajia</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>119.75</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>122.25</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>25.375</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>21.5</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2000</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2004</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><references>1154050153424</references></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Study site</title><para>Soils were collected at Tatajia, a subalpine area in the saddle of Jade Mountain (Yushan), central Taiwan (23828 N, 120854 E). The elevation is 2700 m and mean annual precipitation 4100 mm and temperature  9.5 C. The area was selected as a representative longterm ecological study site of subalpine forest ecosystems in Taiwan. The study area consists of metamorphosed sedimentary rock (Miocene Epoch) of sandstone and shale. The soils are Humic Dystrudepts with low base saturation. The coniferous forest is dominated by Chinese hemlock (Tsuga chinensis).</para><para>Less dominant species include Taiwan false cypress (Chamaecyparis formosensis), spruce (Picea morrisonicola)</para><para>and Armand&#8217;s pine (Pinus armandi). The grassland is dominated by dwarf bamboo (Yushania niitakayamensis) and alpine silver grass (Miscanthus transmorrisonensis).</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Soil sampling</title><para>Surface soil (0&#8211;10 cm deep) was collected from the O/A horizon at three vegetation zones&#8211;grassland, transition zone and forest&#8211;in April 2000 (spring). Three composite samples were collected in each zone with use of a soil auger (8 cm diameter and 10 cm deep). A mixture of three sampling points formed a composite sample of a given zone. For soil samples with a shallow O/A horizon (b10 cm), the B layer soil was discarded, since microbial activities are concentrated in organic-rich layers. Visible material such as roots and litter were manually removed prior to</para><para>sieving the material through a 2-mm sieve. Soil was kept at 4 8C in the dark before use.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Physical fractionation of the soil</title><para>We used the procedure of Stemmer et al. (1998) to disperse the soil samples by low-energy sonication and separate the particle size fractions by a combination of wet sieving and continuous flow centrifugation. Fresh soil was dispersed in distilled water by use of a probe-type ultrasonic disaggregator (Misonix XL-2020) with 50 J sl output energy for 120 s (about 170 J g1 dry soil). Coarse sand (250&#8211;2000 Am) and fine sand (53&#8211;250 Am) were collected in sieves with a corresponding mesh size. The liquid passing through the sieves contained silt (2&#8211;53 Am) and clay (0.2&#8211;2 Am). The separation of the last 2 fractions and collection of silt (2&#8211;53 Am) were achieved by repeated</para><para>centrifugation at 190g.

The ergosterol was redissolved in 2 ml methanol and filtered through a 0.4-Am membrane filter. Samples (100 Al) were injected into a Spectra- Physics SP 8800 HPLC with a reverse-phase analytical column (Hypersil RPC-18, 5 Am, 1504.6 mm). The flow rate was set at 1.5 ml min1 and UV detector 282 nm. The mobile phase was 97%</para><para>methanol to 3% pure water.

Each soil particle size fraction was treated with no antibiotics (control), 32 mg ml1 streptomycin, 64 mg ml1 cycloheximide and 32 mg ml1 streptomycin combined with 64 mg ml1 cycloheximide. The inhibitor concentrations were selected on the basis</para><para>of the results of Imberger and Chiu (2001). Two replicates were prepared for each treatment. Samples were pre-incubated for 3 days at 25 8C. About 1.2 g of sample was weighed and put into 150-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Two milliliters of solution of glucose (30 mg ml1) and antibiotics were added. The flasks were closed with double-sealed rubber stoppers and incubated at 25 8C. Headspace gas (1 ml) was sampled with use of a gas-tight syringe at the beginning and end of the incubation (5 h). Carbon dioxide concentration was estimated by use of a Hitachi 263-30 GC</para><para>with a 2 m2 mm Hayesep Q stainless steel column, thermal conductivity detector and integrator.
