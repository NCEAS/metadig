From the symptoms induced on banana by these CMV isolates, three symptom types were grouped. Members within each banana symptom type also induced similar symptoms on N. glutinosa. It suggested that members within each banana symptom type do share similar common biological prosperities in inducing symptoms on banana and N. glutinosa. Double stranded RNA analysis revealed that the differential symptoms between groups are not related to the presence of satellite RNA. On the contrary, although cowpea is good hosts in CMV grouping based on the ability of CMV in cowpea systemic infection, the grouping is irrelevant in banana symptom inducing. Sequence analysis revealed that the systemic infection of CMV in cowpea reflected in their CP sequence. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed that CMV associated with BMD did not cluster together and were randomly assigned into distinctive CMV subgroup. It indicated several distinctive CMV strains all have the ability to infect banana which will complicate the disease managements. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis using 89 CMV reported around the world reveled that in contrast to the currently known CMV subgroup IA , IB and II, our collected CMV form a new subgroup within subgroup I, and two new distinctive CMV subgroups within subgroup I were also resolved.  Our analysis also pointing out that subgroup IB of CMV is actually phylogeneticlly unresolved and grouping of CMV may need to be further improved.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>banana mosaic</keyword></keywordSet><keywordSet><keyword>cucumber mosaic cucumovirus</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>&#28961;&#12290;</para></intellectualRights><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Taiwan</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>119.625</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>122.125</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>25.625</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>21.375</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><singleDateTime><calendarDate>2007</calendarDate></singleDateTime></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact id="1223344187765" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Hsin-Hung</givenName><surName>Yeh</surName></individualName><organizationName>Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, National Taiwan University</organizationName><address scope="document"><city>Taipei</city><country>Taiwan</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">886-2-33664601</phone><phone phonetype="fax">886-2-23636490</phone></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Samples collection and isolation of virus</title><para>The diseased banana leaves with differential symptoms were collected from southern Taiwan. These samples were checked by ELISA using antibody against CMV before isolation (35). The CMV were isolated from infected plants by rubbing the sap extracted from the infected plant to Chenopodium amaranticolor, followed by three times of consecutive single local-lesion isolations, and then maintained and propagated in N. glutinosa. The CMV were transmitted from N. glutinosa to healthy banana plantlets (about 15 cm in height) by cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii ). The aphids were pre-starvation for 2 hr in petri dishes, and then fed on CMV infected N. glutinosa leaves. These aphids were allowed acquisition access for 30 sec~1 min, and then were transferred to banana leaves for overnight. The bananas were then sprayed with imidacloprid insectcide.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>RNA extraction</title><para>Total RNA were extracted by Trizol&#174; reagent (Invitrogen, Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions, and dissolved in 20 &#956;l DEPC treated water after briefly air dry.</para><para>Amplification of CMV CP gene by RT-PCR</para><para>The RT-PCR reaction were essential the same as described (19).
