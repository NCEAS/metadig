In this study, the crushing strength of Taiwania (Taiwania cryptomerioides Hay) trees using the Fractometer was investigated and the data were used to determine the position of demarcation between juvenile and mature wood. Segmented regression and variance component analysis were used to estimate the demarcation position. Upon increasing the distance from the age, the crushing strength of juvenile wood has been improved. Within-tree variations in wood properties are greater than tree-to-tree variations. In this experiment, the position of demarcation between juvenile and mature wood occurred at an approximate distance of 10.8 cm to 13.2 cm from the pith that was about 18-20 yeas of cambium age.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Taiwania (Taiwania cryptomerioides Hay.)</keyword><keyword>Crushing strength</keyword><keyword>Juvenile-mature wood demarcation</keyword><keyword>Fractometer</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Please inquire of the author.</para></intellectualRights><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Taiwan</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>119.975</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>122.25</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>25.375</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>21.5</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><singleDateTime><calendarDate>2003</calendarDate></singleDateTime></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><references>1164249157000</references></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Plantation site</title><para>Taiwania was selected to test the validity of the variance component and segmented regression analysis for crushing strength. The experimental plantation was located in compartment No.3, Liukuei Experimental Forest of the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute (TFRI). The mean annual temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation were 18.6 &#226;&#132;&#131;, 81 %, and 1150 mm, respectively. The weather can be divided into a dry season and a rainy season. No silvicultural treatment is performed in sampling trees of this plot.

But, the data of suppressed trees are not ideal for strength analysis. 5 Therefore, the samples can be only classified into two types on the basis of DBH, namely, mean 33.6 cm (Type A: 8 trees) and 26.4 cm (Type B: 11 trees) (i.e. dominant trees and intermediate trees, respectively). The two DBH classes are suitable to be used as structural lumber.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Core specimens</title><para>An increment borer was used to cut cores 5 mm in diameter from Taiwania trees. From the eastern aspect of each sample tree, we extracted a pith-to-bark increment core specimen at DBH (same direction) in December 2003, when they were about 32 years old. The increment cores were conditioned in a controlled-environment (20 &#226;&#132;&#131; and 65% relative humidity).

The Fractometer (Type II, IML, Germany) is a device that breaks a radial increment core for the measurement of fracture strength along the fiber. The commercially available Fractormeter was used to evaluate the crushing strength of increment cores from pith to bark per 12 mm. The cylindrical specimen is inserted into the jaws so that the fibers are parallel to the direction of load.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Numbers of measurement</title><para>A total of 14 samples (distance from pith) from each tree (core of Type A) were studied (numbered 1.2 cm, 2.4 cm, 3.6 cm, and so on , up to 16.8 cm outward from pith to the bark) and a total of 11 samples (distance from pith) from each tree (core of Type B) were studied (numbered 1.2 cm, 2.4 cm, 3.6 cm, and so on, up to 13.2 cm outward from pith to the bark) for crushing strength.</para></section></description></methodStep></methods><access authSystem="knb" order="denyFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access><dataTable id="1164253497687" scope="document"><entityName>EML-data for wetnet.csv</entityName><entityDescription /><physical id="1164253496000" scope="document"><objectName>EML-data for wetnet.csv</objectName><size unit="byte">4056</size><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>0</numHeaderLines><recordDelimiter>#x0A</recordDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">ecogrid://knb/zzlin.4.2</url></online></distribution></physical><attributeList><attribute id="1164253497703" scope="document"><attributeName>No. of sample</attributeName><attributeLabel>code of tree</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>sample tree</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>sample number</definition><pattern>1-36</pattern></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute><attribute id="1164253497718" scope="document"><attributeName>Measurements of position</attributeName><attributeLabel>radial position</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>Cores from pith to bark every 1.2cm.</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>distance from pith to bark</definition><pattern>1-36</pattern></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute><attribute id="1164253497734" scope="document"><attributeName>Compressive strength</attributeName><attributeLabel>strength</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>Crushing strength</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><ratio><unit><customUnit>Kilograms per cubic centimeters</customUnit></unit><precision>0.1</precision><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType><bounds><minimum exclusive="true">0</minimum><maximum exclusive="true">1000</maximum></bounds></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale></attribute></attributeList><numberOfRecords>354</numberOfRecords></dataTable></dataset><additionalMetadata><unitList><unitType id="crushingstrength" name="crushingstrength"><dimension name="Amount" power="0.1" /></unitType><unit id="Kilograms per cubic centimeters" multiplerToSI="0.1" name="Kilograms per cubic centimeters" parentSI="kilogramsPerCubicMeter" unitType="crushingstrength"><description>Compressive strength parallel to grain</description></unit></unitList></additionalMetadata></ns0:eml>
