A randomized complete block design was adopted in the field layout with 7-tree linear plots in each of 4 replications and a 2 x 2-m spacing between plants. At a tree age of 27 yr, a 10-mm caliber increment core sample was extracted at breast height in the east cardinal direction from the mid-DBH size tree per plot. Thirty families (out of 50) with 100% survival of trees in each of 4 replications were selected for increment-core extraction. In total, 120 cores (1 core family-1 plot-1 x 30 families x 4 replications) were sampled. From each core, only the 6 outermost growth rings near the bark were used to assess the specific gravity and tracheid length. Variations among provenances and among families within a provenance were analyzed using a general linear model. No significant difference among provenances was found in either trait. Significant variations among families within provenances were detected at the 5% level for specific gravity but not for tracheid length. Tree-to-tree variations in both traits accounted for more than 80% of the total variances. The overall mean values were respectively 0.494 for wood specific gravity and 3.16 mm for tracheid length. The family heritability estimate for tracheid length was 0.296, which was weaker than that for wood specific gravity (0.412). Therefore, different strategies of future selection programs are discussed.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Qenetic variation</keyword><keyword>Calocedrus formosana</keyword><keyword>Specific gravity</keyword><keyword>Tracheid length</keyword><keyword>Heritability</keyword><keyword>Growth ring</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Please inquire of the author.</para></intellectualRights><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Taiwan</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>119.975</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>122.25</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>25.375</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>21.5</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><singleDateTime><calendarDate>2006</calendarDate></singleDateTime></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><references>1164261855562</references></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Experimental stands</title><para>The study plantation was located at the Lienhwachih Research Center (23.56&#195;&#175;&#194;&#130;&#194;&#176;N, 120.54&#195;&#175;&#194;&#130;&#194;&#176;E), Taiwan Forestry Research Institute, in central Taiwan at an elevation of 720 m. It was established in April 1976 with 3-0 seedlings grown from seeds collected from each of 50 open-pollinated families representing 3 different provenances. In other words, as shown in Fig. 1, we respectively sampled 25, 14, and 11 families from 3 natural stands which were 4.2 (A&#195;&#175;&#194;&#130;&#194;&#174;B), 28.6 (B&#195;&#175;&#194;&#130;&#194;&#174;C), and 30.5 (A&#195;&#175;&#194;&#130;&#194;&#174;C) km in linear distance separate from each other. Trees were hand-planted at a 2.0 &#195;&#131;&#194;&#151; 2.0-m spacing with 4 replications, each containing 50 seven-tree row plots which were arranged in a randomized complete block design. The Lienhwachih Research Center is characterized by a mean annual temperature of 20.8&#195;&#175;&#194;&#130;&#194;&#176;C, a relative humidity of 86%, and an annual precipitation of 2180 mm. The rainy season extends from March to September. This study plantation has received no thinning since its establishment.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Speific gravity (SG)</title><para>In November of 2000 at a tree age of 27 yr, a 10-mm caliber increment core sample was extracted at breast height (130 cm above the ground) in the east cardinal direction from 1 mid-DBH-sized tree per plot. In conifers, the breast height sampling is generally satisfactory for evaluating wood SG and other wood properties of the entire tree. The use of mid-DBH-sized tree for the increment core sampling was because it most closely represents the provenances in a statistical sense. Only 30 families with 100% survival of trees in each of 4 replicates were selected for increment-core extraction. And only the 6 outermost growth rings near the bark of the increment cores were extracted and used to assess the SG and TL. This is generally because increment boring of only the 6 growth rings near the bark not only helps minimize damaging effects on study trees, but also provides sufficient data to assess genetic information on wood SG and other properties.A mixture of 95% ethanol: benzene (1:2 v/v) was used to remove the extractives from the core samples. The SG of the extracted sample was determined by the water displacement method according to Smith.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Tracheid length</title><para>After the SG determination, each of the same 6 growth rings was cut under a magnifying glass and placed in a test tube for chemical maceration at 40&#195;&#175;&#194;&#130;&#194;&#176;C for about 1 wk. The test tubes contained a mixed solution of 30% H2O2: distilled water: glacial acetic acid (1:4:5 by volume). After maceration, the fibrous tracheids were washed with distilled water, dispersed, and mounted on microscope slides, and finally stained with safranin-o. seventy tracheids from each of early- and late-wood of the a growth ring were measured with an ampliscope and averaged to represent the mean value for that ring. All 6 outermost growth rings were used as an experimental unit to report the open-pollinated family values. In total, 120 cores (1 core family-1 plot-1 x 30 families x 4 replications) were analyzed.</para></section></description></methodStep></methods><access authSystem="knb" order="denyFirst"
