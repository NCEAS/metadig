It was triploid (2n = 123) and produced 32-spored sporangia. Spore germination and gametophyte development were of &#8220;Vittaria-type&#8221; and &#8220;Adiantum-type&#8221;, respectively. Adult gametophytes were heart-shaped and naked. Both male and female gametophytes appeared in the cultures, but no hermaphroditic ones were found. Antheridia released active sperms, but archegonia did not develop well and lost function. Young sporophytes were produced apogamously, directly from the cells of cushion of ventral surface of gametophytes behind the notch. The first frond of young sporophyte was of midribed type and pinnate.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>apogamy</keyword><keyword>chromosome</keyword><keyword>Diplazium megaphyllum</keyword><keyword>gametophyte</keyword><keyword>reproductive biology</keyword><keyword>spore</keyword><keyword>young sporophyte</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Diplazium megaphyllum (Bak.)

Christ, A Rare Fern in Taiwan, Survives Through Apogamous Reproduction</title><para>Three sporophytes of Diplazium megaphyllum, locating at Hwalian and Nantou, were transplanted to the fern greenhouse of Taiwan Forestry Research Institute (TFRI) (Table 1). After 3 months culture, root tips of the sporophyte collected from Hwalian were squashed following modified Sharma&#8217;s method for somatic chromosome observation (Sharma 1982).</para><para>To estimate the number of spores per sporangium, fresh fronds with mature sporangia were collected and 10 haphazardly sporangia per sporophyte were sampled. Then these fronds were air dried for 2 days to release spores. The ratio of normal (non-abortive) spores was observed by haphazardly sampling 100 spores from each sporophyte within two days of release. Under the microscope, the sizes (length of long axis) of 100 non-abortive haphazardly selected spores from each plant were measured.</para><para>Germination rate was determined by sowing spores, on member filters (pore 0.45&#956;m, 47mm in diameter, Gelman Laborator) which laid on the Kingroot medium (vermiculite: peat: perlite = 4:4:2; South Sea Vermiculite and Perlite Co., Taipei, Taiwan). Totally 400 spores, 100 spore/filter, 4 filters per plant, were haphazardly selected to count. All cultures were maintained under white fluorescent illumination of ca. 24 &#956;mole m-2s-1, 12 h/d. Temperature ranged from 20 to 28&#8451;.</para><para>To observe gametophyte development, spores from different sources were sown on the Kingroot medium directly. The sexual expression, age and size of gametophytes (from 100 haphazardly selected gametophytes per plant) were recorded every 2 weeks. Five antheridium-bearing gametophytes, derived from spores of each sporophyte, were immersed in 70% alcohol for a week. Five antheridia of each gametophyte were sampled, and the sperm numbers per antheridium were counted.</para><para>The morphology of gametophyte and young sporophyte were all observed under microscopes (Leica, Wild M8; Leitz, Dialux 20), and pictures were taken with the aid of digital camera (Nikon, Coolpix 995).</para></section></description></methodStep><sampling><studyExtent><description><para>Diplazium megaphyllum
