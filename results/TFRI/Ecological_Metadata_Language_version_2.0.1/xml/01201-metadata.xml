In electron microscopic observations, typical bacilliform virions measuring 130&#8211;158&#215;27&#8211;42 nm were observed in infected bougainvillea tissues. The transmission tests demonstrated that the virus could be easily transmitted among different bougainvillea cultivars by bud grafting but not by mechanical inoculation. BsCVBV showed different pathogenicity to various bougainvillea cultivars in our inoculation tests. The Taipei-Red and Thimma cultivars showed the apparent foliar symptoms of chlorosis, chlorotic spots, wrinkling and leaf-distortion; the original species of Bougainvillea glabra produced chlorotic spots and vein clearing on leaves without wrinkling or leaf distortion; both &#8216;Mrs. Eva Mauve Variegata&#8217; and Hati Gadis showed mild mottling and faint spots of leaves; Helen Johnson was tolerant to BsCVBV. Our devised PCR-based assays demonstrated that BsCVBV could replicate and persistently survived in all tested bougainvillea cultivars used in this study although it induced different symptoms in them. The BsCVBV-1 primer pair devised from our cloned BsCVBV-specific DNA fragments proved to be efficient in the PCR assays for the rapid and specific detection of BsCVBV in Taiwan, and this PCR-based method is helpful in the quarantine, inspection and ecological studies for BsCVBV in Taiwan.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Bougainvillea</keyword></keywordSet><keywordSet><keyword>Bougainvillea spectabilis</keyword></keywordSet><keywordSet><keyword>chlorotic vein-banding virus</keyword></keywordSet><keywordSet><keyword>cultivars</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>&#28961;&#12290;</para></intellectualRights><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Taiwan</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>119.625</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>122.125</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>25.625</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>21.375</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><singleDateTime><calendarDate>2007</calendarDate></singleDateTime></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact id="1223348838125" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>T.-H.</givenName><surName>Hung</surName></individualName><organizationName>Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, National Taiwan University</organizationName><address scope="document"><city>Taipei</city><country>Taiwan</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">886-2-33664604</phone><phone phonetype="fax">886-2-23636490</phone></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Plant and virus sources</title><para>The diseased bougainvillea plants suspected to be infected by BsCVBV were collected from the Taipei-Red cultivars (Bougainvillea buttiana, a hybrid derived from Bougainvillea Glabra&#215;B. peruviana), which were previously grown on the campus of National Taiwan University in Taipei. These infected bougainvilleas exhibited symptoms such as mottling, chlorosis, vein banding and stunting. They were directly used in the identification of pathogen, and the one showing the most apparent and severe symptoms was further propagated by the cutting method for a donor plant of inocula in the graft-inoculation tests.</para><para>Five additionally important bougainvillea cultivars in Taiwan such as B. glabra &#8216;original species&#8217; (ORI), B. glabra &#8216;Mrs. Eva Mauve Variegata&#8217; (MEMV), B. glabra &#8216;Hati Gadis&#8217; (HG), B. buttiana &#8216;Helen Johnson&#8217; (HJ) and Bougainvillea spectoglabra &#8216;Thimma (TH) (Vicky)&#8217; (a hybrid derived from B. spectabilis&#215;B. glabra) were used in the bioassays with graft inoculation aside from the Taipei- Red cultivar for comparative symptomatology. All these 3 cultivars with different morphological properties in their flowers and leaves (Cullen, 2001; MacCubbin &amp; Tasker, 2002) were originally obtained from the nursery or greenhouse at the Department of Horticulture at National Taiwan University and were tested for BsCVBV infection using the PCR assays described later to confirm that they are free from BsCVBV. To avoid the possibility that the parts of genomic DNA of Badnavirus integrated into the host genome, all vegetative materials such as grafting budwoods and cutting twigs for propagation of healthy bougainvilleas must be BsCVBV free through the confirmation of PCR assays. The BsCVBV-free cultivars were used as mother plants to produce more seedlings for further inoculation tests.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Mechanical inoculation and graft inoculation with BsCVBV</title><para>For biological identification, the BsCVBV extracts from diseased bougainvillea tissues were used to inoculate several indicator plants such as Chenopodium amaranticolor, Chenopodium quinoa, Datura stramonium, Nicotiana glutinosa, Nicotiana benthamiana and Nicotiana tabacum through mechanical transmission. The inoculated plants were kept in a greenhouse under temperature control at 25&#8451; for the observation of symptom development.</para><para>Budwood grafting methods of Su &amp; Chu (1984) and Yoshida (1996) were chosen for the graft inoculation. In total, six bougainvillea cultivars as described abovewere inoculated with the BsCVBV-infected scions of the Taipei-Red cultivar by grafting. Each cultivar had four replicates of seedling (50 cm tall, 1-year old) for the objective results, and each receptor plant was graft inoculated with two diseased scions at the 10- and 40-cm positions from the top of bougainvillea seedling. Grafting was judged successful when the scions survived for more than 3 months after grafting. All the inoculated bougainvillea seedlings were grown in a greenhouse under temperature control at 25&#8451;. Symptom development was observed and recorded periodically, and all tested plants were sampled monthly for total nucleic acid extraction followed by the PCR-based detection of BsCVBV. The healthy bougainvillea seedlings without graft inoculation were also prepared for the negative controls under the same growth conditions.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><para>For the preparation of virus samples for transmission electron microscopy, virus particles were purified from the diseased bougainvillea tissues according to the methods described by de Silva et al.

In brief, the diseased leaves were homogenised in the extraction buffer [0.25 M Tris&#8211;HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% (w/v) sodium sulphite, 4% (w/v) polyvinyl pyrrolidone 40, 0.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.25% diethyldithio-carbamic acid] with a tissue blender. The sap was clarified through muslin filtration and then added slowly with Triton X-100 (final concentration of 2%) under room temperature. The sample was clarified again through centrifugation 4 (12 000 g for 20 min at 10&#8451;). The supernatant was mixed with polyethylene glycol (MW 6000) in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl and kept at 4&#8451; for 4.5 h.

One drop (approximately 20&#956;l) of the virus preparation as mentioned above was placed on the grid, incubated for 1 min and then removed by filter paper slip. Another drop of 1% phosphotungstic acid (PTA) was put on the grid for approximately 5 min for negative staining. The grid was dried in a vacuum desiccator after removing PTA.
