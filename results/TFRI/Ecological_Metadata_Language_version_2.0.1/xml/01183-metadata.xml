Freshly harvested, mature seeds of both species germinated; 90% after 3 weeks incubation at 30/20C. Seeds of C. manillana survived desiccation to 5.6% moisture content (MC) (fresh weight basis) during storage at 4oC for 6 months without loss of viability, which thereafter decreased gradually. However, viability of seeds with a MC &#226;&#137;&#165; 5.6% decreased more rapidly during storage at 15C than at 4C. Survival of seeds stored at -20C was lower than that of seeds stored either at 4 or 15oC. Nevertheless, maximum viability of Champereia seeds with a MC of 5.6% was maintained in liquid nitrogen (-196C). Thus, C. manillana exhibited intermediate seed storage behaviour. Seeds of S. octophylla survived desiccation to 6~7% and -20C storage for 24 months without loss of viability. Seeds of this species with a MC &#226;&#137;&#164; 6.2% also survived in liquid nitrogen, whereas viability was reduced to about 50% of that of seeds originally dried and not stored in liquid nitrogen. Thus, seeds of this species exhibit orthodox storage behaviour.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Champereia manillana</keyword><keyword>Schefflera octophylla</keyword><keyword>seed germination</keyword><keyword>cryopreservation</keyword><keyword>intermediate storage behaviour</keyword><keyword>orthodox storage behaviour</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>If you want to use the information, please contact with me.</para></intellectualRights><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Taiwan</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>120.38</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>121.01</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>24.17</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>21.58</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2003-11-28</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2006-11-28</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><taxonomicCoverage scope="document"><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Family</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>Araliaceae</taxonRankValue><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Genus</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>Schefflera</taxonRankValue><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Species</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>octophylla</taxonRankValue></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicClassification><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Family</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>Opiliaceae</taxonRankValue><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Genus</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>Champereia</taxonRankValue><taxonomicClassification><taxonRankName>Species</taxonRankName><taxonRankValue>manillana</taxonRankValue></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicClassification></taxonomicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><references>1154058666272</references></contact><methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Seeds</title><para>Mature orange-red fruits (drupes) of C. manillana were harvested from two trees growing in Kenting, Pingtung County on the southern tip of Taiwan in 2004. Mature purple-black fruits of S. octophylla were harvested from four or five trees at each of three collection sites in 2003 (see Table 1). Champereia seeds plus endocarps (hereafter seeds) were extracted directly by washing fruits in water and removing the exocarp and mesocarp. The three lots of Schefflera fruits were placed in a greenhouse equipped with automatic mist spray systems for 2~3 days until the fleshly pericarp rotted, and then the seeds were extracted by washing fruits in water. The clean, sunken seeds of both species were allowed to dry 5~6 hours at room temperature, after which they were stored temporarily in sealed containers at 4oC before treatments. Seeds of S. octophylla were separated by 2 mm screen mesh, and seeds that remained on the screen were used for tests. The white-gray seeds of C. manillana have a fully-developed embryo, a thin endocarp and a membranous seed coat; no endosperm is present. The dark gray seeds of S. octophylla consist of the seed coat and a small embryo [embryo length : seed length = 0.251 &#194;&#177; 0.026 (SE), n = 15] surrounded by a large amount of endosperm.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Drying treatments and storage</title><para>Fresh seeds of C. manillana with an original MC of 28.3% were dried in a sealed container (40 x 25 x 25 cm) with silica gel inside. A small fan was placed inside the container for air circulation; temperature outside the container was maintained at 15oC. A standard sample for estimating MC of the seeds was removed from the sealed container at frequent internals, weighed and then returned to the container. The approximate MC of these seeds was determined using a &#226;&#128;&#156;generic&#226;&#128;&#157; standard curve (decrease in seed weight vs % MC of seeds). When an approximate desired MC of the standard sample was reached, seeds to be used for various storage treatments were removed from the sealed container for testing actual MC and wrapped in laminated aluminium foil. Actual MCs of seeds then were determined with three replications of 15 seeds and calculated on a fwb after oven drying for 17 h at 103oC (ISTA, 1999). Thus, seeds with MCs of 5.6, 11.3 and 16.3% were obtained. They were sealed in laminated aluminium foil and stored at 15, 4 and -20oC. After 0, 1, 6, 12 and 18 months, three replications of 30 seeds for each of these storage temperatures were tested for germination. Thus, the total number of treatments for seeds of C. manillana was 45 (3 MCs x 3 temperatures x 5 storage periods = 45). Fresh seeds of S. octophylla were dried at various relative humidities (RHs) maintained with saturated salt solutions of LiCl (RH 14%), CaBr2 (RH 20%), MgCl2 (RH 33%) and Ca(NO3)2 (RH 56%) in closed containers at 15oC for 14 days, and MC of seeds was allowed to reach equilibrium with the RH of the inside air (Vertucci and Roos, 1993). MC of seeds taken from containers was measured following ISTA (1999) procedures using three replications of 30 seeds for each treatment and site, after which the seeds were quickly sealed in laminated alumininum foil and stored at 15, 4 and -20oC until tested for germination. At intervals of 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24 months, three replications of 50 seeds for each of these storage conditions were tested for germination. Thus, the total number of treatments for each collection site was 60 (4 MCs x 3 temperatures x 5 storage periods = 60).</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Liquid nitrogen storage</title><para>Using the procedures described above, seeds of C. manillana were dried to a MC of 5.6% and those of S. octophylla from Liukuei and Tasueshan to MCs of 4.4, 4.7, 5.1, 5.5, 6.2, 7.6 and 10.4%, and then they were sealed in aluminium foil packets for storage at liquid nitrogen (-196&#194;&#176;C). Seeds in the aluminium foil packets were immersed directly into liquid nitrogen (hereafter LN) for storage. Each storage treatment consisted of three replications of 30 seeds for C. manillana and of 50 seeds for S. octophylla. After 1, 6 and 12 months for C. manillana and 4, 8, 12, 24 for S. octophylla, seeds were removed from LN, placed at -20&#194;&#176;C for at least four hours and then at 4&#194;&#176;C for several hours, after which they were tested for germination at 30/20oC in light.</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Cold moist storage</title><para>Fresh seeds of S. octophylla from the three collection sites were mixed with moist sphagnum, sealed inside polyethylene bags and stored at 4&#194;&#176;C in darkness for 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 months prior to testing them for germination.
