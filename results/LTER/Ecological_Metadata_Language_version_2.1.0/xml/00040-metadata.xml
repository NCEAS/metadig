Most of the prairies had developed after being abandoned from agriculture, but none of the savannahs had been cultivated. The history of burning varied between sites. Insects were sampled via sweep-net sampling, pitfalls and ant plates throughout the growing season in each of 49 grassland fields and savannahs. In total, 89,596 individuals of 1,167 species were captured and enumerated. Body size was measured for a subset of grasshoppers collected. The study was conducted in 1992 by the lead investigators: John Haarstad, Evan Siemann, and David Tilman.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword keywordType="theme">burning</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">ecology</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">ecosystems</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">insects</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">species</keyword></keywordSet><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage id="geoReferenceID" scope="document"><geographicDescription>The Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN. CCNHA lies at the boundary between prairie and forest. It is a mosaic of uplands dominated by oak savanna, prairie, hardwood forest, pine forests,and abandoned agricultural fields and of lowlands comprised of ash and cedar swamps, acid bogs, marshes, and sedge meadows. Large tracts of the pre-agricultural ecosystems of the region are preserved within its boundaries, as is a successional chronosequence of more than 80 old fields of known history.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-93.22445</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-93.16289</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>45.44138</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>45.384865</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1992</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>1992</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Dan</givenName><surName>Bahauddin</surName></individualName><organizationName>Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve</organizationName><positionName>Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Ecology Evolution and Behaviour Dept.

Insects were also collected using pitfalls in some of the prairies and savannas. Once during the growing season ants were sampled using scent plates. 
 
Sweep-net sampling occurred within each field using 100 sweeps per sample. 
 
Pitfall traps were placed at the end of 4 permanently marked transects within the sites sampled. Five scent plates were placed evenly from end to end along the transects, thus providing 20 samples per site. The transects were parallel to each other, 25m apart, and in the prairies 40m long and in the savannas 50m long. 
 
Insects were sampled 7 to 9 times throughout the 1992 growing season. All specimens were manually sorted and identified to species (89.8% of specimens) or morphospecies within known genera or families.  
 
Species biovolume, an index of biomass, was calculated as the average product of length (from tip of head to top of abdomen), width (maximum width of body or head) and thickness (maximum thickness of body or head) for 5 specimens in the oldest life stage for each Orthoptera species. Even though body size increases greatly during development, this method seemed justified since most species (84%) only occurred as adults in the samples taken.  To minimize counting a species twice, all larvae were examined by outside experts and, if they might have been the same species as an adult insect, they were counted as a single species. 
 
Voucher specimens were deposited in the Cedar Creek insect collection.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></para></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Site details</para></listitem><listitem><para>This study included 38 prairies that had developed from fields which had been abandoned from agriculture at various times in the past and 11 savannas. Twenty-two of the prairies that were associated with experiments E014, E054 and E001. One of the savannas was associated with experiment E001. Some of the prairies were periodically burned. All of the savannas had a burn history. 
 
Listing of Site Details 
 
In Current Site Label, P=Prairie and B=Burn Unit.  In Last year Cultivated Historical, the years represent the last year of cultivation based on historical documents and interviews of former farmers and/or  family members. In Last Year Cultivated Aerial Photographs the years represent estimates of the last year of cultivation based on an historical series of aerial photographs. Pitfall Method and Ant Plate Method columns indicate the sites in which these collection methods were used.
