 <abstract><para>[Missing any annual plankton and CTD data sets from this study]

Prince William Sound (PWS) is one of the largest areas of protected waters bordering the  Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  It, and the nearby open waters of the Gulf, provide foraging areas for populations of apex predators including piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals.  These surface- dependent predators were adversely impacted by the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (EVOS); and many experienced declines from which they have not recovered. Piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals in PWS are near the apex of food webs based on pelagic production of small fishes, including Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus),  walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus); and macroinvertebrates, especially euphausiids, commonly called krill.  The lack of recovery by some seabirds may be due to long-term changes in forage species abundance.  In this report we describe abundance and distribution patterns of small pelagic fishes in Prince William Sound, based on acoustic surveys. 

The research described in thls report was part of a program (APEX) designed to determine if prey availability is limiting the recovery of seabird populations that were impacted by the EVOS.  The main tool for measuring the distribution and abundance of forage fishes is hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can measure horizontal and vertical abundance and biomass at scales not possible by traditional net sampling techniques, and has been used to quantify fish (Thorne et al. 1977, Thorne et  al. 1982, Mathisen et al. 1978) and the spatial patterns of a variety of aquatic populations (Gerlotto 1993; Baussant et al. 1993; Simard et al. 1993).  Ln  Alaskan waters, acoustics have been used to measure biomass relative to tidally-generated frontal features (Coyle and Cooney 1993) and the relationship between murre foraging, tidal currents and water masses in the southeast Bering Sea (Coyle et al. 1992). Acoustic sampling cannot positively identify the species of targets; consequently,  net sampling must be conducted concurrently with acoustics to identify species and to provide size distribution data necessary for biomass estimations.

<methods><methodStep><description><section><title>1995 Acoustic Surveys</title>
<para>Field Methods: Field studies were conducted in the summer (July and August) and in the fall of  1995.  Surveys were conducted in three areas designated as the north, central and south study sites. Within each study site, hydroacoustic data were collected along a series of offshore, parallel,  east- west transects spaced at 2.0 nautical mile (nm) intervals; and a series of inshore, zig-zag transects that usually ran between the shoreward ends of the offshore parallel series (Figures 2,3,4). Inshore transects are identified by the inclusion of a z in the transect code.</para>
<para>The summer survey was conducted from two vessels, an acoustic/bird observation vessel and a mid-water trawl vessel.  Surveys were conducted during daylight hours, typically between 0600 and 2000.  The acoustic vessel would acoustically survey a series of transects. From 8 October - 15 October additional sampling was conducted in the three study areas.</para>
<para>The fall survey was conducted from a single research vessel equipped for both acoustic and mid- water trawl sampling. Limited time available for fall sampling precluded a complete survey of the three study areas; consequently, the objectives were to investigate the distributional patterns of forage species in selected areas offshore and in nearshore embayments and to collect specimens for food habits and condition studies. This report includes the methods but no results from the fall sampling, as those data are still being analyzed.</para>
<para>Acoustic Methods:Data were collected with a 420 kHz Biosonics Model 120-121 echo-integration system. The data were integrated over 1 m depth intervals, corrected for calibration and stored to disk. Standard transects were run at 6 knots with the transducers towed beside the vessel. Both side-look and down-look data were collected. The effective range of the equipment was 65 m from the transducers. All data and analyses in this report are based on transect data using this equipment.</para>
<para>Data were also collected with a 120 kHz DT4000 digital echo-sounder.  The echo-sounder failed to function during the first pass through the study area. After repairs, the machine functioned during portions of the second half of the cruise, however, the data contained spikes of around 30 dB in magnitude, data from the bottom of fish schools and below fish schools occasionally blanked out, and secondary bottom reflections occasionally contaminated the data.  The digital data set will require extensive editing to remove defective segments; consequently, results from analyses of digital data are not included in this report.</para>
<para>In the July/August cruise, acoustic data were collected on 167 individual transects, most of which were transects in the three study sites that were visited twice each.</para>
<para>In the October cruise, acoustic data were collected on the preselected transect lines and at a number of collection sites within bays where concentrations of forage fishes occurred.</para>
<para>Analytical Methods:Biomass estimates were developed by scaling acoustic data based on the  length distributions of the dominant fish species collected by  mid-water trawl in each study area. Estimates of the number of individual fish per cubic meter are determined by  an equation relating acoustic target strength to fish length.  The numbers of fish are then converted to an estimate of biomass per cubic meter using the length-weight relationship for the dominant species.  Finally,  biomass per cubic meter estimates are converted to biomass per square meter of surface by integrating the results over the depth of the sampled water column. Length to target strength relationships were taken from the literature, and the length-weight equations were from our unpublished data in PWS or from literature sources.</para>
<para>A  randomization  technique was used for statistical analyses.  The data were integrated from 65 m depth to  25 m (deep) and from 25 m to the surface (shallow).  The shallow and deep data sets from a given region during a survey were linked into a single data string. A random number generator was used to pick starting points in the string. A length of data equal to the average transect length was then extracted and a mean biomass computed.  The procedure was repeated until a length equal to the total length of the data set was sampled once and a mean was computed.</para>
<para>The above procedure was repeated 1000 times in a boot-strapping technique.  The average of the 1000 runs through the data set was computed, the values for each individual run were ranked; the 25th and 975th values indicate the 0.05 confidence intervals.</para>
<para>Geographic distributions of  forage species were assessed by developing area plots of biomass density gradients determined through a kriging routine. The kriging method has a gridding algorithm (we used a minimum curvature algorithm) that estmates the data between transect lines based on estimates of spatial variation along the transect lines.  Therefore, the most accurate point estimates are those occurring closest to the lines in regions where transect density is highest. Land masses were overlaid on the area plots after the gridding algorithm had been run.</para>

<para>Offshore Survey: The offshore acoustic/bird survey was conducted from the observation vessel F/V CAPE ELRINGTON.  Surveys were conducted during daylight hours, typically</para>
<para>between 0600 and 2000.  The acoustic vessel  surveyed a series of  transects. The transects were in a pattern of  parallel transects through each area, terminating at shorelines as close as possible to the shore. Patterns to be run in each area followed a preselected series of  transects spaced at two mile intervals.  Data were collected with a 120 kHz BioSonics Model 101 Scientific Echosounder, with the transducer deployed in down- looking mode from the towed vehicle.  Signal processing was accomplished with a BioSonics Model 221 ESP Echo Integrator.</para>
<para>Nearshore  Survev</para>
<para>The F/V MISS KAYLEE  conducted a series of  hydroacoustic transects in the three study areas, working in the same general area as the offshore survey on each day.  On July 26 and 27 the CAPE ELRINGTON conducted the nearshore survey due to failure of  acoustic equipment on the MISS KAYLEY.  The equipment on the MISS KAYLEE was a Biosonics ESP 420 kHz analog down- looking and side-looking system multiplexed with a 130 kHz DT6000 digital down-looking system.  On July 19th the ESP 420 kHz system failed and beginning on July 20th the inshore survey was continued with only the DT6000 system.  On July 25th the DT6000 system also failed, and it was replaced with a DT5000 system.  The DT5000 system failed almost immediately; consequently, the nearshore survey was completed using the CAPE ELRINGTON and the ESP 120 kHz system.</para>
<para>Inshore transects were in a pattern of  zig-zags  within 12 krn segments of shoreline.  The 12 km study site segments were laid out sequentially through the shoreline within each study area.  The number of  12 km study sites within each study are:  North - 26, Central - 8, South 21 (Figures 5 - 7).  Since time constraints precluded sampling all of  the shoreline in the North  and South areas, a systematic sampling plan was followed, and every other study site segment was sampled, with random removal of additional segments to further reduce the number  as necessary.  Segments sampled were:</para>
<para>North:  1,3,5,7,9,13,15.  17,19</para>
<para>Central:  1-8</para>
<para>South:  2,4,6,10,14,16,18,20</para>
<para>Each 12 km study site was further divided into ten 1.2  km beach sections, with the starting and ending points of each beach section marking the shoreward turning point in a series of  20 transects were laid out following a zig-zag pattern (10 zigs, 10 zags), with each transect about 1.2 km long.  The acoustic transects are identified by a alpha-numeric designation, for example:  N03-02A</para>
<para>N - indicates the North study area</para>
<para>03 - indicates the third 12 km shoreline segment</para>
<para>02 - indicates  the second beach section, or second set of  zig-zags</para>
<para>A -  indicates the first of  the two zig-zag transects off  beach section 2.</para>
<para>Offshore Survey Data Analyses: Averages were calculated for each transect within two depth strata: 1 - 25 m and 26 - 100 m.  the deeper stratum extends further than the previous year (100 m ve. 65 m) because of the lower frequency (120 kHz vs. 420 kHz) used in 1996. A scaling factor of - 30 dB/Kg of  fish biomass was used to convert echo integration measurements to fish density.</para>
<para>Nearshore Survey Data Analyses: Biomass estimates were developed by scaling down-looking acoustic data based on the  length distributions of  the dominant fish species collected  in each study area.  Estimates of  the number of  individual fish per cubic meter are determined by  an equation relating acoustic target strength to fish length. Data were collected using the default target strength of -42.2 dB.  Equations to convert fish length (L, in cm, log base 10) to target strength (TS) were:</para>
<para>pollock  TS = 20 (log L) - 66</para>
<para>herring  TS = 20 (log L) - 68</para>
<para>sand lance  TS = 20 (log L) - 93.7  (based on 38 kHz system)</para>
<para>Differences between the computed target strength and the default target strength were used to rescale the data. Estimates of  fish numbers were converted to an estimate of  biomass per cubic meter using the length-weight relationship for the dominant species. Equations to compute biomass (W - in grams, L - in mm)  were:</para>
<para>pollock:  W = (1.89 x 10-6) L^ 3.272</para>
<para>herring:  W = (5.007 x 10- 6) L^ 3.196</para>
<para>sand lance: W = (4.81 x10- 7) L^ 3.451</para>
<para>Biomass per cubic meter estimates were converted to biomass per square meter of  surface by integrating the results over the depth of  the sampled water column.  Length to target strength relationships were taken from the literature, and the length-weight equations were from our unpublished data in  PWS.</para>
<para>Geographic distributions of  forage species were assessed by developing area plots of  biomass density gradients determined through a kriging routine.  The kriging method has a gridding algorithm (we used a minimum curvature algorithm) that estimates the data between transect lines based on spatial variation along the transect lines.  Therefore, the most accurate point estimates are those occurring closest to the lines in regions where transect density is highest.  Land masses were overlaid on the area plots after the gridding algorithm had been run.</para>
<para>Biomass estimates for each of  the nearshore 12 krn sampling sites were developed by calculating the mean for each set of  zigs and zags separately, and an overall estimate was calculated by including all transects (zigs and zags) in the average.  The estimate of  nearshore biomass in each of  the three study areas (North, Central, and South) was produced by averaging the overall estimate from each of  the sampling sites.</para>
<para>Depth profiles of  temperature, salinity and sigma-t were plotted for all CTD casts.  We also evaluated geographic patterns in offshore water structure by plotting isotherm and isohaline lines over series of  stations in the North (Valdez Arm), Central (east of  Knight Is.) and South (Knight Island Passage) study areas.</para>
<para>Geographic patterns of  temperature and salinity were plotted for series of CTD stations extending from nearshore to offshore in the North (Port Fidalgo), Central (MacPherson Passage), and South (Knight Island Passage) study areas to determine if  tidal fronts were found in the nearshore areas of the Sound.  In addition, two die1 CTD stations were sampled every 6 hours over a 24 hour period in Bainbridge Passage to determine if  tidal currents were strong enough to break down the vertical stratification of  the water column.</para>

<para>Filed Methods: Sampling was  conducted in three cruises in 1997.</para>
<para>Cruise  97-1,  17 May  -  23  May  1997. Vessel:  FUV  PANDALUS - Alaska Fish and Game research vessel. The WV PANDALUS conducted a series of hydroacoustic transects in the northern and southern study area of Prince William Sound.  The transects were in a pattern of parallel lines through each area, terminating as close as possible to the shore.  Patterns run in each area followed a pre-selected series of north-south transects spaced at 1.5 mile intervals.  The equipment used was a Biosonics DT 4000,  120 kHz down-looking system.  Field calibration of the acoustic equipment was done on 18 May.</para>
<para>Cruise 97-2  , 17 July  -  7 August1997. Vessels:  MlSS KAYLEY - Nearshore acoustic and process study vessel; PAGAN - Nearshore and offshore catcher, video, CTD, beach seine vessel; CAPE ELRINGTON - Offshore acoustic vessel; PANDALUS - ADF&amp;G  research vessel. The MlSS KAYLEY conducted nearshore acoustic survey consisting of a series of hydroacoustic transects in four study areas, using a Biosonics DT  4000,  120 kHz down-looking system.  The transects were in a pattern of zigzags within 12 km segments of shoreline.  The 12 km study segments were laid out sequentially through the shoreline within each study area.  The number of  12 km segments within each study area were:  North -  26,  Central -  8,  South -  21, Montague - 2  Each 12 km segment was further divided into ten 1.2  km beach sections, with the starting and ending points of each beach section marking the shoreward turning point in a series of 20 transects (10 zigs and 10 zags). Each transect was about 1.2  km long.  The study segments sampled in each area were: North  (1,  3,  5,  7,  9,  13, 15, 17,  19); Central (1-8); South  (2,  4,  6,  8,  10, 14,  16,  20); Montague (1, 2). Field calibration of  the acoustic equipment was done in the morning of July 21.</para>
<para>The CAPE ELRINGTON conducted a series of hydroacoustic transects in four areas, using a Biosonics DT4000 120 kHz  down-looking system The transects were  in a pattern of parallel transects through each area,  terminating at shorelines as close as possible to the shore.  Patterns to be run in each area followed a pre-selected series of transects spaced at two mile intervals.  The acoustic system was field calibrated on 3 August.</para>
<para>Cruise 97-3,  30 September -  10 October. Vessel:  FUV  PANDALUS - ADF&amp;G research trawl vessel. Acoustic transects were run in the North and South study areas to assess the abundance of</para>
<para>pelagic fishes; the transects planned for the Central study area were cancelled due to bad weather .  The equipment used was a Biosonics DT4000 digital system with a120 kHz transducer.  Field calibration of the acoustic equipment was conducted on 8 October in Whale Bay.</para>
<para>Acoustic Data Analyses: The GPS produced errors in the distance estimations.  The magnitude 01 the errors was a function of the distance between sampling points. As the vessel speed and direction varied substantially along the transects, uncorrected distances were  estimated to be in error by as much as 800%.  The error was  estimated as follows:  A straight transect was  selected</para>
<para>(M0109a).  Data were  extracted without averaging from the raw data files.  The distance between the start and end points was calculated and assumed to be the best overall estimate of the actual transect length (e.g.  the error component was  lowest relative to actual distance between points).  Distances between successive points were then calculated and summed to produce an estimate of the transect length from individual increments.  The correction factor was computed as the endpoint distance divided by the total increment distance.  The lag between distances was incremented and the procedure repeated to produce estimates of the correction factor required for each distance increment.  The results were plotted and a function was fit to the curve to produce an estimate of the correction required for any given distance.  The corrected distance was equal to the uncorrected distance multiplied by the uncorrected distance divided by the uncorrected distance plus an error component. The error component varied substantially relative to distance between points.  The error was modeled by log transforming the distance and error estimates and fitting the results to an eight degree polynomial. The beta parameters were computed using the program error.  These parameters and the correction factor were applied to each distance increment in the data files to correct estimates of distance between successive points.</para>
<para>Each data record consisted of 1 m depth increments from 1 m below the transducer to the bottom or about 115 m depth, whichever was greater.  Averaging was done using geometric means. The program returned volume scattering, depth, and latitude and longitude for each record.  Various parameters in the bottom tracking software were modified to avoid integrating through the bottom.  The bottom window was varied from 20 to 40 m,  with larger values for files with steeper slopes.  A  cross section of the volume scattering for each transect was plotted using visual basic software.  Files were scanned visually, and estimates of species identification and size class were made for all substantial acoustic targets . The bottom files were edited to remove any bottom integration left in the data.</para>
<para>Due to variations in vessel speed and direction, the distance included by successive integrations in the output file varied substantially.  The  portion of the total transect abundance or biomass value contributed by each integration was estimated by multiplying the  integrated value by the integration distance divided by the total transect length.</para>
<para>The volume scattering was corrected for  calibration by the standard target.  Calibration indicated that the receive sensitivity and source levels  were producing over- estimations of the volume scattering by about 3.39 dB.</para>
<para>The default sound scattering was assumed to be plankton with a target strength of -70 dB/g.  Identified fish targets were scaled using target strength to length equations. Estimates of the number of  individual fish per cubic meter were determined by equations relating acoustic target strength to  fish length.</para>
<para>Herring: TS  = 20*log10(length(cm))  - 68 From Thorne</para>
<para>Pollock: TS  = 20*log10(length(cm)) - 66 From Thorne</para>
<para>Capelin: TS = 20*log10(length(cm))  - 64.9  From Rose &amp;  Leggett</para>
<para>Rockfish: TS = 20*log10(length(cm))  -  67.1  From MacLennan &amp;  Simmonds</para>
<para>We  could find no target  strength-length relationships for  sandlance at 120 kHz; therefore, a  default target strength was used.  We  assumed all sandlance were 70 mm in length and assigned them a target strength of -67 db per fish.  Rockfish length was assumed to be 250 mm based on video data.</para>
<para>Estimates of  fish numbers were converted to an estimate of biomass per cubic meter using the length-weight relationship for the dominant species.  Equations to compute biomass (W -  in grams,  L -  in mm)  were:</para>
<para>pollock  W  =  (1.89  x  10-6) L^ 3.272</para>
<para>herring  W  =  (5.007  x  10- 6)  L^ 3.196</para>
<para>sand lance  W = (4.81  x  10 -7)  L^ 3.451</para>
<para>capelin  W  =  (2.40  x  10-6) L^ 3.213</para>
<para>rockfish  w = (7.5  10-3) L^ 3.2</para>
<para>Biomass per cubic meter estimates were converted to biomass per square meter of surface by integrating the results over the depth of the sampled water column.</para>
<para>Geographic distributions of  forage species were assessed by developing area plots of biomass density gradients determined through a kriging routine.  The kriging method has a gridding algorithm (we used a minimum curvature algorithm) that estimates the data between transect lines based on spatial variation along the transect lines.  Therefore, the most accurate point estimates are those occurring closest to the lines in regions where transect density is highest.  Land masses were overlaid on the area plots after the gridding algorithm had been run.</para>
<para>Biomass estimates for each of the nearshore 12 km sampling sites were developed by calculating the mean for all transects in the  site.  All transects within a sampling site that had acoustic backscatter above a minimum threshhold were examined in detail, and any concentration of acoustic backscatter was identified based on target verification sampling.  A biomass estimate for each transect was calculated by partitioning each transect by the target type with calculation using our best model of target strength.</para>
<para>The estimate of  nearshore biomass in each of the three study areas (North, Central, and South) was produced by averaging the overall estimate the sampling sites in the study area.</para>
<para>The procedures used to estimate nearshore biomass density in 1997 differed in several ways from the 1996 procedures.  In order to make the estimates from 1996 comparable to 1997 we  reanalyzed all of the 1996 nearshore acoustic data using the procedures above.</para>

<para>segments sampled in each area were: North (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17, 19), Central (1-3, 6-8), South (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 16, 20), Montague (1). Field calibration of the acoustic equipment was done in the evening of July 24 using a standard target suspended under the transducer. Acoustic targets found by the survey vessel were sampled using a fry seine, purse seine, dip net, jigging or ROV (Remote Operated Video) .</para>
<para>Acoustic Data Analyses: Each data record consisted of 1 m depth increments from 1 m below the transducer to the bottom or about 115 m depth, whichever was greater.  Averaging was done using geometric means-  The program returned volume scattering, depth, and latitude and longitude for each record.  Various parameters in the bottom tracking software were modified to avoid integrating through the bottom.  The bottom window was varied from 20 to 40 m, with larger values for files with steeper slopes.  A cross-section of the volume scattering for each transect was plotted using visual basic software,  Cross-sectional plots were scanned visually, and estimates of species identification and size class were made for all substantial acoustic targets.  The files were edited to remove any bottom integration left in the data. The portion of the total transect abundance or biomass value contributed by each integration was estimated by multiplying the integrated value by the integration distance divided by the total transect length.  The volume scattering was corrected for calibration by the standard target.</para>
<para>The default sound scattering was assumed to be plankton with a target strength of -70 dB/g.  For identified fish targets, estimates of the number of individual fish per cubic meter were determined by equations relating acoustic target strength to fish length.</para>
<para>Herring :  TS =  20*log10(length(cm))  - 71.9</para>
<para>Pollock:  TS =  2O*log10(length(cm))  - 66</para>
<para>Capelin:  TS =  20*log10(length(cm))  - 74.6</para>
<para>Rockfish:  TS =  20*log10(length(cm))  - 67.5</para>
<para>Sand lance:  TS =  20*log10(length(cm))  - 85</para>
<para>Estimates of fish numbers were converted to an estimate of biomass per cubic meter using the length-weight relationship for the dominant species.  Equations to compute biomass (W - in grams, L - in mm)  were:</para>
<para>pollock:  W =  (1.89 x  10-6) L^ 3.272</para>
<para>herring:  W =  (5.907  x  10-6) L ^ 3.196</para>
<para>sand lance:  W =  (4.81  x 10 -7) L^ 3.451</para>
<para>capelin:  W =  (2.40 x  10-6) L^ 3.213</para>
<para>rockfish:  W =  (7.5  10-3) L^ 3.2</para>
<para>Biomass per cubic meter estimates were converted to biomass per square meter of surface (biomass density) by integrating the results over the depth of the sampled water column. Biomass density for each transect was calculated by partitioning each transect into sections based on the targets present.  Biomass density was estimated for each 12 km sampling segment  by  calculating the mean  for all transects in the segment. Biomass density in each of the three study areas (North, Central, and South)  was estimated by averaging all transects in the area.  Geographic distributions of forage species were assessed with area plots of biomass density gradients determined through a kriging routine.</para>
<para>The procedures used to estimate biomass density in 1998 were similar to those used in 1997; however, the target- strength models used in 1998 were changed for several species.  In order to make the estimates from 1996 and i597 comparable to 1998 we reanalyzed the 1996 and 1997 acoustic data using the new target-strength models.</para>
<para>The 1996 data were collected with two BioSonics acoustic systems: a DT6000 130 kHz digital system and a 120 kHz ESP system.  The DT6000 system was used for the South and Central surveys, but failed in the North survey two days before the end of the cruise. Therefore, the last two days of transecting in the North area were done with the 120 kHz ESP system. When tank calibrations were made on the DT6000 system following repair, changes in source level and receive sensitivity decreased the resulting volume scattering by about 5 dB from that computed by receive sensitivity and source level values read from the EEPROM (the system software program).  Since no standard target calibration was done on this system prior to its field deployment, it was unclear which values were correct.  In 1997 we ran standard target calibrations on the DT4000 system during field collections.  In comparing the DT data from the two years, we found that the 1997 integrated volume scattering was very similar to that observed in the 1996 data, if the original 1996 data were corrected to incorporate the 5 dB decrease in volume scattering indicated in the 1996 post-season tank calibrations. Consequently we adjusted the 1996 DT6000 data by the 5 db increment indicated in the 1996 post-repair calibration. Also, for the 1996 North area data, direct comparison of the ESP data with the DT data is complicated by the fact that the DT systems are much quieter.  When integrating the ESP data, the noise is summed as well as the actual acoustic backscatter, producing inflated estimates of volume scattering per unit area relative to estimates by the DT systems.  Similar integrated volume scattering plots could be generated for data from the DT and ESP systems if the noise level for the ESP system were set to -60 dB in contrast to -80 dB for the DT systems.  When this correction is applied to estimates of biomass using the ESP system, estimates for fish school biomass remains similar but plankton estimates drop.  Comparison of plankton estimates obtained with the DT and corrected ESP data suggest that the -60 dB noise floor is more appropriate for the ESP system than the -80 dB noise floor used by the DT systems; therefore we used the -60 dB value in our calculations of the ESP data from 1996.</para>
