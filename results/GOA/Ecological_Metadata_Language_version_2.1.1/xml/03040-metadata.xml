 <abstract><para>CYP1A has been used widely as an indicator of exposure of vertebrates to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and the use of EROD activity as a measure of CYP1A has been validated and accepted as a standard method. EROD activity has been used since 1998 as an indicator of the degree of exposure of harlequin ducks to residual Exxon Valdez oil in Prince William Sound, Alaska. These data have proven to be extremely valuable for understanding the processes by which population recovery of harlequin ducks has been constrained following the Exxon Valdez oil spill. EROD activity data were collected in 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2005 from wintering harlequin ducks captured in Prince William Sound; one reason for collecting these data was to provide a time series with which changes in exposure could be tracked over years. However, the data reported from the laboratory varied dramatically in magnitude from year to year, to a degree far beyond what could be expected due to normal biological variation. Similar variation was observed across years in harlequin ducks held at the Alaska SeaLife Center under strictly controlled circumstances. Therefore, this project was initiated to determine the explanation for this interannual variation, and to apply laboratory analyses and data standardization to allow valid interannual comparisons. Additional data analysis of EROD activity of wintering harlequin ducks captured in Prince William Sound in 2005 through 2007 confirmed that individual attributes (age, sex, and mass) and season of capture did not explain observed variation in EROD activity. In review of the originally reported EROD values, it was discovered that some data were reported in incorrect units. However, even after these were corrected, the large interannual discrepancies were not completely resolved. Other potential factors, such as low protein yields, were considered; exclusion of samples with low protein values, along with application of appropriate units, considerably reduced interannual variation, although differences were still apparent that reduced confidence in interannual comparisons. EROD reanalysis of old samples resulted in data that were correlated (R2 = 0.53) with original data, but values were considerably different in magnitude, possibly as a result of sample degradation or annually varying lab techniques or equipment. Also, not all individuals had adequate sample volume remaining for reanalysis, reducing the power for detecting differences across areas and years if only reanalyzed data were used. In consultation with the laboratory, it was concluded that changes in analysis approaches and equipment may have led to the observed interannual differences and that, although within-year comparisons between areas were valid, between-year comparisons were not appropriate without corrections. Therefore, a method indexing CYP1A values was created that allows for interannual contrasts, in which average EROD activity for harlequin ducks captured at our unoiled/control area (Montague Island) is set to 1 for each year and all values are adjusted accordingly within
the same sample year. Therefore, for each year, the average indexed EROD activity for
birds from oiled areas is a ratio of oiled to unoiled averages. The average indexed values
can be compared across years to consider annual changes in oil exposure, under the
assumption that oil exposure at unoiled Montague Island was the same across years.
Further, the indexed values can be calculated for each individual, which allows
consideration of relationships between individual variation in oil exposure and variation
in survival.</para>

 <para>Harlequin ducks were captured in 1998 (31 March - 9 April), 2000 (7 - 14 November), 2001 (31 October - 11 November), 2002 (17 November - 2 December), and 2005 (5 - 16 March) using a modified floating mist net (Kaiser et al. 1995). Upon capture, all birds were transported by skiff to a larger vessel where U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service bands were affixed, morphological measurements taken, and surgeries were conducted to take a small (&lt;1g) liver biopsy for CYP1A analysis. Sex determinations were made based on plumage characteristics and cloacal examination and age class was determined by probing bursal depth (Mather and Esler 1999). During 1998 and 2005, all age and sex cohorts were sampled; in 2000, 2001, and 2002 only females (of all age classes) were sampled, as a key part of the study (EVOSTC Project //423) was to evaluate the relationship between oil exposure and female survival. Sample sizes by year and treatment are presented in Table 2.</para>

 <para>For experiments at the Alaska SeaLife Center, adult female harlequin ducks were captured during wing molt in early September. Twenty-five were transported by float plane to the Alaska SeaLife Center in each year of the study (2000 and 2001), where they were held in captivity for the duration of the winter and used as subjects in the experiments described below and in Bodkin et al. (2003).</para>
 <para>Captive harlequin ducks were housed in a mesh-enclosed outdoor pen exposed to local climate and photoperiod conditions. The enclosure was partitioned into three 3.7 x 3.7 m sections, each with a flowing seawater pool (2000-01: diameter 1.8 m, depth 0.9 m; 2001- 02: diameter 2.4 m, depth 0.6 m). The captive diet consisted of ad libitum commercially obtained Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) presented in trays on land during winter 2000-01, and an ad libitum mixed diet of Atlantic silversides and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) placed in pools during winter 2001-02. Freshwater was offered in each pen in heated plastic bowls to prevent freezing, along with a mixture of sand and crushed oyster shell for grit.</para>
 <para>In both years of the oil ingestion experiment, birds were given 4 weeks to acclimate to the captive environment and diet before the start of oil-dosing. After acclimation, the 21 birds that had adjusted to captivity best, based on maintenance of body mass, were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments (control, low-dose, high-dose), each with 7 birds. The birds assigned to each treatment group were kept together in one of the 3 partitions of the outdoor enclosure. Each bird was banded with a pair of colored plastic tarsus bands to allow identification of individuals. The average body mass (+/- 1 SD) of the harlequin ducks used in the study was 523.0 +/- 25.8 g and was similar in both years.</para>
 <para>Different dosing regimes were used in the 2 years of the oil ingestion experiment. In 2000, dosing was conducted twice weekly. Low-dose birds were fed 1 mL of oil per kg body mass at each dosing, high-dose birds were fed 10 mL of oil per kg body mass at each dosing, and controls were fed no oil, although they were handled identically to the dosed birds. Doses were administered via gavage with a syringe and feeding tube; control birds were gavaged with an empty feeding tube. Dosing was done in the morning before birds had fed. The dosing regime was changed in the second year of the study to better simulate low-level, intermittent ingestion of weathered crude oil. During winter 2001-02, dosing was conducted every other day in the evening, after birds had fed. Lowdose birds were fed 0.57 mL of oil per kg body mass, high-dose birds were fed 5.71 mL of oil per kg body mass, and control birds were handled identically, but were fed no oil. The cumulative dose over a 2-week period for each treatment was equivalent in both years of the study (low-dose 4 mL kg-1, high-dose 40 mL kg-1), but doses were smaller</para>
 <para>and more frequent in the second year. In both years, birds were held for 60-90 minutes after dosing in an indoor, mesh-bottomed pen before being returned to the outdoor enclosure to prevent contamination from oily excreta.</para>
 <para>Birds were dosed with weathered crude oil from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. To simulate weathering, crude oil was mixed with seawater and stirred continuously for 10 days at 25degC, after which it was separated from water and stored in air tight containers until</para>
 <para>dosing. Doses were based on body masses measured at the previous handling event. Dosing occurred between 15 October 2000 and 20 February 2001 during the first year (total dosings = 37), and between 15 October 2001 and 10 February 2002 in the second year (total dosings = 60). Birds that became sick during the course of the experiment were treated by ASLC veterinary staff. If possible, oil-dosing was continued through the course of treatment; however no data were collected until sick birds returned to good health as judged by the veterinary staff. If the illness was severe, the sick bird was removed from the experiment. Mortalities unrelated to oil-dosing occurred in all 3 treatments during both winters of the experiment. The sample sizes for CYP1A analysis at the end of dosing were 17 in 2000-01 and 18 in 2001-02. At the end of the oil dosing experiments, liver biopsies were taken from captive birds (23-24 February 2001 and 10 February 2002). Sample handling followed the same</para>
 <para>procedures as described above, and samples were sent to the laboratory for analysis at the same time as samples from wild-captured birds for each year.</para>

 <para>Frozen liver samples from field and captive bird studies were shipped in liquid nitrogen to the laboratory of Dr. John Stegeman at the Wood's Hole Oceanographic Institute for preparation and analysis. Individual liver pieces were homogenized in 7 ml final volume homogenizing buffer (0.05 M Tris, 0.15 M KCl, pH 7.4), and microsomes sedimented by differential centrifugation. Samples for reanalysis, archived at Woods Hole as prepared microsomes, were resuspended in approximately 2 ml per g tissue with resuspension buffer (0.05 M Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 20% v/v glycerol, pH 7.4). Protein was determined in a 96 well plate. 7-Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), the catalytic function of hydrocarbon-inducible CYP1A, was measured using a kinetic modification of the plate-based assay. EROD activity was determined in duplicate in a 48 well plate at 20 degC using a Cytofluor fluorescent plate reader (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Each well contained 200 microliter consisting of 1microliter of microsomes (4-15 microgram protein), 2 micromoles 7-ethoxy resorufin in 50 mM Tris buffer, 0.1 M NaCl, pH = 7.8. Catalytic activity was initiated by the addition of NADPH in buffer to a final 1.67 mM concentration. Fluorescence was determined at 1 min intervals over 6 min, and the linear slope (fluorescence per minute) was divided by the slope of the resorufin product standard curve (fluorescence per pmol) determined under the same conditions to yield pmol per minute per mg protein catalytic rates.</para>
 <para>To consider potential confounding effects of age, sex, and body mass on interpretation of interannual variation, data from 2005 were used to analyze effects of these variables, along with area (oiled versus unoiled), on variation in reported EROD activity. Of the 20 birds captured in oiled areas, 5 were adult (after-hatch year) females, 1 was a juvenile (hatch year) female, 13 were adult males, and 1 was a juvenile male. In unoiled areas, the sample consisted of 7 adult females, 1 juvenile female, 11 adult males, and 1 juvenile male. Variation in EROD activity in relation to age, sex, body mass, and area was analyzed using general linear models in SAS. Model selection and inference was conducted in an information-theoretic context (Burnham and Anderson 2002), in which support for various model configurations is contrasted using Akaike's Information Criterion, corrected for small sample size (AICc). The candidate model set for this analysis included all additive combinations of explanatory variables, as well as a null model. The model with the lowest AICc value is considered to have the strongest support from the data. Another metric, AICc weight (w), was calculated for each model; these sum to 1.0 across the entire model set and provide a clear measure of relative support for candidate models. The variables included in the models with highest support are considered to explain important variation in the response. Parameter likelihoods, which are the sums of w for all models including a given parameter, indicate the relative support for that variable, taking into account model uncertainty. Parameter likelihoods close to 1 indicate strong support.</para>
 <para>The first step in the evaluation of the observed interannual variation in reported EROD activity data was a thorough data review, in which the Wood's Hole scientists doublechecked the analysis results spreadsheets and we confirmed linkages to capture databases. A subset of archived samples from 2001 with adequate microsome volume was reanalyzed using EROD activity methods described above. A simple linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between original and archived samples; a relationship with low unexplained variation (high R^2) and a slope near 1 would indicate that archived samples could be used to double-check questionable values originally reported by the lab.</para>
