 <abstract><para>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration treatment effects studies from 1989 through 1997 suggested that bivalve assemblages on beaches in Prince William Sound treated with high-pressure washing were severely injured in terms of abundance, species composition, and function. Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage by sampling various treated and untreated sites in 2002. We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Site selection</title>
 <para>To optimize the potential for detecting treatment effects, sampling was focused on intertidal mixed-soft sediment beaches in central and southwestern PWS where the greatest quantities of oil from the spill were stranded.  Using the NOAA Shoreline Segment Summary and Alaska Department of Natural Resources GIS databases and historic spill-survey documents from 1989 and 1990, appropriate shoreline segments were selected based on exposure, sediment type, degree of oiling, and recommended treatment history.  A random selection of appropriate shoreline segments was made from this list.  Each of the selected segments was then physically viewed during an aerial reconnaissance to determine where suitable sites with an adequate stretch of beach composed of mixed-soft sediments existed at an appropriate tidal elevation.  Final selections were made randomly from this final list of confirmed workable sites.  Four sites from the previous NOAA program were included to assess the degree of consistency with the NOAA studies.  These included one reference site (Bay of Isles) and three treated sites (Northwest Bay West Arm, Shelter Bay, and Sleepy Bay).</para>
 <para>Determining the treatment history for any particular stretch of shoreline was a somewhat difficult and complex task.  In the manner previously reported by Mearns (1996), we used NOAA's Shoreline Segment Summary database to assign substrate type, relative degree of oiling (no-, light-, moderate-, or heavy oiling), types of treatment (e.g., moderate- to high-pressure or warm- or hot-water), number of types of treatment, and number of treatment days on a segment.  Mearns (1996) concluded that, although "...treatment varied greatly among shorelines...treatment effort was generally proportional to the amount of oil present." According to his data for Eleanor and Ingot Islands, 81% of the heavily oiled sites were exposed to warm or hot water and 71% were exposed to both.  In addition, 80% of the moderately oiled sites were exposed to warm or hot water.  Only about 10% of the moderately or heavily oiled segments were not treated or did not have accompanying treatment characterization.  From these data, one can conclude that most heavily or moderately oiled sites were washed with hot or warm water.</para>
 <para>However, we are unaware of any available public records that actually record treatment for the particular beaches within a portion of a shoreline segment.  Detailed oiling reports and recommended treatments are recorded in the Shoreline Cleanup Assessment Team (SCAT) reports (available at the Alaska Resource Library and Information Services in Anchorage), which include sketches of the distribution of oil and sediments.  The oiling reports and treatment recommendations in these records formed the predominant basis for our decisions on which beaches to survey.  However, it should be clear that, except for the NOAA Treated sites, where we were able to observe treatment underway in 1989, the treatment history of both Treated and Reference sites is based only on educated conjecture.  It is likely that some of the sites were inadvertently misclassified.</para>

 <para>Bulk sediment samples were collected at all sites for analysis of particle grain size (PGS), total organic carbon (TOC), and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN).  These samples were composited from surficial sediments scooped approximately 2 cm deep at points immediately adjacent to three randomly selected sampling locations for the infaunal samples.  Thus, the single composite-sample method did not provide a measure of within site variance.  Each sample was preserved by freezing.</para>
 <para>PGS distributions were determined using a pipette method (Plumb 1981) modified to correct for dissolved solids (i.e., salinity and the dispersant added to keep silt/clay particles from clumping). Percent weights within each phi category were used to calculate cumulative phi values for 16, 50, and 84 percent of each sample.  Two statistics were determined from these values.  Median grain size = phi50.  Median grain size in mm = 2exp(-phi50).  The equation used to calculate the sorting coefficient for each sample = (phi84-phi16)/2.</para>
 <para>In the laboratory, the samples used for analysis of organic nutrients in the sediments were purged of inorganic carbon, dried at 70 degrees C, ground, and sieved through a 120 mesh screen.  TOC was measured on a Dohrman DC 180 Carbon Analyzer using EPA method 415.1/5310B.  TKN was measured by chromate digestion as described in EPA Method 351.4.  Quality control (QC) for TOC included analysis of standards, method blanks, and comparison of replicate analyses.  All QC analyses for TOC fell within acceptable QC limits.  QC for TKN included analyses of spiked blanks and replicate analyses of spiked samples.  All of the spiked TKN blank analyses fell within QC limits.  However, none of the RPD or REC for the replicate analyses was within QC limits.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Shoreline Exposure</title>
 <para>Because many physical and biological variables can be correlated with the intensity of exposure to wave action, variations in exposure to wave action can be a confounding factor.  One commonly used method for estimating exposure is to measure fetch, i.e., the unobstructed distance across open water that wind or waves travel before encountering a beach at a perpendicular angle.  Accordingly, we estimated fetch for each site by measuring the distance to the nearest landfall in a directly offshore direction using a navigation chart.</para>
 <para>Nevertheless, using fetch as a measure of exposure is a very crude and potentially inaccurate approach.  It ignores the importance of the direction from which the dominant wind or waves arrive, the seasonal differences in the potential velocity and frequency of winds from the direction of the fetch, and the mitigating effects of local topography and offshore bathymetry (subtidal reefs, etc.), all of which are poorly known in this region.  Consequently, we devised another approach that integrates a variety of exposure-related physical and biological factors to provide an index of exposure.  Using our site photos and field notes to assess the various criteria, we devised an ordinal evaluation of twelve site conditions that reflect the degree of exposure.  The factors included seven physical characteristics of the beach (shape and weathering of individual rocks, degree of imbrication or armoring of the rock population, presence of silt on coarser sediments or rocks, and the susceptibility of the site to current or wave action), and five biological characteristics (absence or level of development of epibenthic algae, animals, or an amorphous biological turf on the rocks, eelgrass or burrowing organisms in the sediments).  Each feature was scored on a scale of 1 to 5.  We then averaged factor scores for each site to provide an integrated exposure score for each site.  By this method, low exposure scores indicate protected sites whereas high scores indicate exposed sites.  Each site was scored without knowledge of its treatment classification in order to avoid biasing the score.  The exposure scores were then paired with the appropriate environmental or biological variables for each site to evaluate the importance of exposure in any observed patterns.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Biological Sampling</title>
 <para>In the NOAA studies cited above, we used a clam-gun core to sample infauna and the associated bivalves.  It became clear when we analyzed these samples that this approach provided good information on smaller clam species and juveniles of larger clam species but did not provide adequate data on abundance and size structure of the naturally less abundant, older, larger size clams.  This shortcoming created an important gap in our understanding of the long-term dynamics of clam populations and recovery.  Consequently, we chose to use two contrasting methods to gain a fuller understanding of population and recovery dynamics.  Smaller bivalves were sampled using core samplers 10.7 cm in diameter (0.009 m2) by 15 cm deep, replicating the methods used in the NOAA study.  Five cores (total of 0.045 m2 sampled) were collected at randomly selected locations along a 30-m transect laid horizontally at each site at the lowest feasible level for completing the sampling and within the specified elevation range (0 to 0.8 m [+2.6 feet] above MLLW); the actual level varied with differing tide stage.  Each sample was field-sieved through a 1.0 mm mesh screen, washed into a double-labeled Ziploc bag, and fixed with buffered 10% formalin-seawater solution.  These samples were collected to provide data consistent with and comparable to the NOAA program and to gain an understanding of the status of smaller clam species and younger size classes of the larger, more longevous clams.</para>
 <para>For the larger, older, less abundant and typically more dispersed bivalves, sediments were excavated to a depth of 15 cm using a shovel and hands inside a square 0.0625-m2 quadrat.  Three replicate excavations (a total of 0.1875 m2 sampled) were collected adjacent to first, third, and fifth randomly placed core samples described above.  These sediments were sieved on site through 6.35-mm (0.25-inch) mesh hardware cloth, the bivalves removed, placed in labeled bags, and frozen for shipment to the laboratory.  This approach provided useful information on abundance and size and age structure of the larger size classes.  These samples were collected to gain an understanding of the status of older size classes of the larger, more longevous clams</para>
 <para>The two sample types provide complementary data.  The core data provide data on a wider spectrum of sizes but, because larger animals are generally rare, these data are better suited for evaluation of the smaller clams and juveniles of the larger species.  This component is lost in the sieving process for the excavation samples but, because that approach samples four times the surface area, it provides substantially better information on the larger, less abundant clams.  Processing the excavation samples with the finer mesh sieve used for the core samples would require an inordinate amount of time both in the field and in the lab.</para>
 <para>Following receipt in the laboratory, the samples were washed on a 1-mm sieve to remove the formalin-seawater solution and then preserved with 70% isopropyl alcohol.  After identification and enumeration in the laboratory, shell length was measured with digital calipers to 0.1-mm precision.  In addition, age was estimated for four species (Protothaca, Saxidomus, and Hiatella, Macoma inquinata) by counting growth checks (annuli).  Arbitrary size criteria based on examination of the size-frequency histograms for each species were used to distinguish juveniles from adults for one set of analyses.  For Protothaca, specimens &lt;10 mm in shell length were classified as juvenile.  For Saxidomus, Macoma inquinata, and Hiatella, shell length criteria for juveniles were &lt;12, &lt;15, and &lt;6 mm, respectively.</para>
