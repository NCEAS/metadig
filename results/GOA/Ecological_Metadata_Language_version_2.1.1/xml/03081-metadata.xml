<abstract><para>The circulation in Kachemak Bay is driven primarily by the 8-meter tidal flux. Regional circulation is characterized by generally cyclonic ocean currents in the Gulf of Alaska flowing onto the shelf off of Cook Inlet.  Nutrient rich bottom water is upwelled and mixed with surface water.  These enriched waters may enter into Kachemak Bay, the inflow tending to stay along the southern shore flowing past the Seldovia instruments, while water flowing out of the bay stays along the Inner Bay and north shore, flowing past the Homer instruments.  These trapped coastal flows separate the bay into two distinct ecosystems, and the instruments are positioned to reflect this distinction.  Within each system there is vertical stratification of the water.  The vertical placement of the sondes is designed to help elucidate the differences in circulation of the surface and deep waters. 
	
As the inflowing water proceeds up the bay, fresh water runoff from the surrounding ice fields and watersheds dilute the salinity and increase the sediment load in the path of the Homer instruments.  The in-flowing water, in the path of the Seldovia instruments, initially supports a marine system, while the northern out-flowing water of the Homer instruments is more estuarine.  The Kachemak Bay water quality instruments capture this difference with deployments along the north and south shores.  These data will be used to supplement studies on primary productivity, larval distribution, settlement, recruitment, growth rates, community dynamics, and biodiversity in the bay.

Data can also be accessed through the National Estuarine Research Reserve System Centralized Data Management site: http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/get/export.cfm</para>

 <para>A Sutron Sat-Link2 transmitter was installed at the Homer Dolphin Deep (NESDIS ID # 3B00077A WQ) station on 12/13/05 and at the Seldovia Deep (NESDIS ID # 3B040240 WQ) site on 07/31/2007, and these transmitters send data to the NOAA GOES satellite.  The transmissions are scheduled hourly and contain four (4) data sets reflecting fifteen minute data sampling intervals.  Upon receipt by the CDMO, the data undergoes the same automated primary QAQC process detailed in Section 2 above.  The "real-time" telemetry data become part of the provisional dataset until undergoing secondary and tertiary QAQC and assimilation in the CDMO authoritative online database.  Provisional and authoritative data are available at http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu.</para>
 <para>Both telemetered instruments are normally housed in ABS pipe mounted vertically on the ferry docks of Homer and Seldovia.  The pipes are positioned to ensure that the sensors are approximately 1 meter above the bottom.  However, because of ongoing issues with the Seldovia deployment apparatus, the Deep site was relocated to one meter above the bottom on the Surface site deployment cable for the entire year.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Calibrations</title>
 <para>Calibration and deployment were performed monthly using methods outlined in the YSI</para>
 <para>Operating and Service Manual.  After cleaning the data loggers, the dissolved oxygen (DO) membrane is replaced and allowed to season in water-saturated air for at least 12 hours before the DO sensor is calibrated.  The pH, conductivity, depth, and turbidity sensors are calibrated using the following standards purchased from YSI (except depth): pH 7 and 10, conductivity standards of 50 mS/cm, respectively, and depth of 0.  Turbidity standard of 123 NTU is purchased from YSI.</para>
 <para>The Chlorophyll probe is calibrated at zero in DI water. QA/QC of this parameter is conducted by comparing sonde data to our monthly grab samples that are analyzed on a Turner 10-AU Spectrophotometer (see Nutrient data/metadata for 2011). Sonde data are accepted or rejected based on this comparison.  The estimates of chlorophyll concentration produced by the YSI chlorophyll probe are meant to complement the more accurate results obtained by the monthly grab samples.</para>
 <para>The NERR System-Wide Monitoring Program utilizes YSI data sondes that can be equipped with either depth or water level sensors.  Both sensors measure water depth, but by convention, level sensors refer to atmospherically vented measurements and depth refers to non-vented measurements.  Readings for both vented and non-vented sensors are automatically compensated for water density change due to variations in temperature and salinity; but for all non-vented depth measurements, changes in atmospheric pressure between calibrations appear as changes in water depth.  The error is equal to approximately 1.03 cm for every 1 millibar change in atmospheric pressure, and is eliminated for level sensors because they are vented to the atmosphere throughout the deployment time interval.  ALL DATA HERE ARE NON-VENTED VALUES since no vented level data was recorded.</para>

 <para>Kachemak Bay is located approximately 200 kilometers south of Anchorage, on the western shore of the Kenai Peninsula.  Kachemak Bay, at 59.6 degN and 151.5 degW, is a temperate regional fjord with hydrographic conditions unique among the NERR system estuaries.  The tidal range of 8 meters is among the largest in the world, and salinity ranges from near zero at stream mouths to 33.0 PSU at the entrance to the inner Bay.  The bay is 35 kilometers wide at its mouth and approximately 57 kilometers long.   The head of Kachemak Bay is located to the northeast at the Fox River Flats, and the mouth lies to the southwest, along a line between Anchor Point and Point Pogibshi. The 6 kilometer long Homer Spit that extends into the Bay from the northern shoreline splits Kachemak Bay into inner and outer bays. The Kachemak Bay NERR comprises the entire inner Bay and the outer Bay.  Water flows between the inner and outer Bays through a narrow opening formed between the Spit and the southern shoreline. The Bay has an average depth of 45 meters, and a maximum of 200 meters.  Fresh water introduced primarily by the Fox, Bradley, and Martin Rivers and Sheep Creek at the head of the Bay, flows along the northwest shore of the inner Bay.</para>
 <para>The Homer YSI data logger site is located on the north side of Kachemak Bay at 59.6028 degN and 151.4081 degW.  The "deep" sonde is deployed at a depth 1 meter from the bottom, in water fluctuating between 8.0 and 17.0 meters.  The "surface" data sonde is deployed at a nominal depth of 1 meter.  The bottom habitat is predominantly sand.  Pollutants in the area are from the excessive boat traffic at the entrance of the Homer harbor, and a nearby fish waste outfall line.  Throughout the year, salinity has ranged from 20.5 to 31.7 ppt, as the instrument's location in the stratified water column is dependent on tide height, with a tidal range of 8.1 meters.  It is predominately an estuarine environment during summer months when glacial runoff is highest, and during the winter months it reverts to a more marine-like system with glacial runoff at a minimum.</para>
 <para>The Seldovia YSI data logger site is located on the south side of Kachemak Bay at 59.4413 degN, 151.7186 degW, approximately 24 kilometers west of the Homer site.  As with the Homer site, the data loggers are situated on the ferry terminal dock, with one instrument 1 meter below the surface, and one 1 meter above the bottom, in water fluctuating between 5.0 and 13.3 meters.  The access to Seldovia is limited to boat or air, as the site is located off the highway system.  The bottom habitat is predominantly rocky substrate.  Pollutants in the area are minimal.  Throughout the year, salinity has ranged from 25.0 to 32.9 ppt at this site with a tidal range of 8.0 meters.</para>
