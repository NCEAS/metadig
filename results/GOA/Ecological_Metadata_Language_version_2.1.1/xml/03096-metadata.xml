 <abstract><para>An oceanographic measurement system aboard the Alaskan ferry Tustumena operated for four years in the Alaska Coastal Current with funding from the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, the North Pacific Research Board and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Sampling water from the sea chest of the ship at 4m, the underway system measured: (1) temperature and salinity: basic physical variables, (2) nitrate: an essential phytoplankton nutrient, (3) chlorophyll fluorescence: an indicator of phytoplankton concentration, (4) colored dissolved organic matter fluorescence: an indicator of terrestrial runoff, and (5) optical beam transmittance: an indicator of suspended sediment. The measurements show large spatial variability at short time scales, but spatially coherent climate change over annual time scales. Governed by snow and ice melt, the ocean climate transitioned from a warm, fresh regime in 2004-2005 to a cold, salty regime in 2007-2008. Agreement with observations at the GAK1 monitoring site near Seward, AK, extends their applicability to the northern Gulf of Alaskas continental shelf. Nitrate and chlorophyll measurements show nutrient-rich periods lead to increased phytoplankton. A computer monitor displayed the water temperature along the route and mapped the progress of the ferry. The successful measurement program and connections to long-term climate change demonstrate the utility of oceanographic measurements from ferryboats.

<para>The underway seawater observing system consisted of several parts. Located in the port shaft alley of the ship, a seawater intake line tapped off an existing seachest air vent whose inlet was approximately 4 meters below the water line. Water flowed at about 3.3 L/min through 1.45 m of insulated 1-inch-diameter copper-nickel pipe, a manual shut-off valve, 0.31 meters of bare pipe to an in-line digital temperature sensor, 0.31 meters to a coarse sea strainer that removed marine debris, 0.51 meters to a 1-to-1/2-inch reducer fitting and 3.40 meters of 1/2-inch-diameter copper-nickel pipe to the self-contained main instrument box. The stainless steel instrument box was plumbed with a total of 6.40 m of 3/8-inch-diameter Tygon tubing. Within the box, seawater flowed through a flow meter, motorized shut-off valve, self-cleaning screen, 1/4-hp Hydra-Cell positive-displacement pump, stilling-well debubbler and to the instrument loop consisting of a flow meter chlorophyll and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorometers, optical transmissometer, 50 micrometers and 1 micrometer filters, optical nitrate sensor and thermosalinograph. Finally water was dumped into the bilge where the ship pumps removed it. below is a list of the oceanographic instruments installed. A Linux computer was located in a waterproof section at the top of the main instrument box. It controlled the sampling via a LabVIEW program. Mounted above deck near the bridge, a global positioning system (GPS) receiver computed the position of the ship and an Iridium satellite modem sent data to PMEL. A second instrument box contained a marine-grade uninterruptible power supply and a Windows computer to drive a public graphical data display in the passenger lounge. The public display showed an image sequence describing the project and continuously updated maps of temperature along the track of the ship. In a later version we added Google Earth images that showed the position of the ship and periodically zoomed out and panned to show the surrounding terrain. Passengers and crew found this useful to monitor trip progress.</para>
<para>The system was designed to operate remotely for days at a time. Data were collected and sent back hourly to PMEL via Iridium satellite modem. Also new instructions could be sent to the system via Iridium to change its sampling criteria and rates. When the ship arrived in port, the system sensed the lack of motion and entered Sleep Mode. The pump stopped to reduce the chance of sucking in marine debris, and measurements and data logging were suspended. In Sleep Mode the position of the ship was monitored. When the ship began moving, the system entered Normal Mode and resumed measuring and logging.</para>

<para>GPS position, intake temperature, thermosalinograph temperature and salinity, chlorophyll and CDOM fluorescence, optical beam transmittance, pressure drop, and flow rate were recorded every 30 seconds and transmitted to PMEL without editing. Because the system could start up at any time, these data did not always fall at integermultiples of 30 seconds on the clock. Hence they were linearly interpolated onto a regular, equispaced time axis at 30-second intervals. The instrumental measurements  contained glitches owing to start-up transients, slow flow, failed sensors, dirty sensors, passing debris, power surges, transmission errors, etc. Usually bad values took the form of spikes, very low values or very high values. Therefore the data required some editing. Random position jumps were removed if they exceeded a 1 degree/time step. Time gaps longer than 4 time steps were identified and the first 14 time steps after each gap were ignored to eliminate start-up transients. By trial and error, a general criterion to remove bad values from all the 30-second data was developed based upon a combination of flow-rate, temperature difference, and salinity values and spikes. Values were eliminated if (a) the flow rate was less than a flow-meter-dependent threshold, (b) the difference between the intake and thermosalinograph temperatures exceeded 3 degrees C, (c) the salinity was less than 2 psu, or (d) salinity jumps exceeded 0.5 psu/time step. In addition, bad chlorophyll fluorescence values were eliminated if the fluorescence voltage was negative or changed by less than 0.0001 or more than 1.2 V/time step. The CDOM measurements in 2004 through July 2006 made with WETStar fluorometers were neglected because they were negative and very much lower than in 2007-2008. The remaining 2006 measurements were dropped because they were noisy and had spurious jumps and trends. CDOM spikes were eliminated if the values changed by more than 6 ppb/time step. Optical transmittance spikes were eliminated if the values changed by more than 2 V/time step. The automated data editing techniques worked well. However for final quality control, graphs of all data were scrutinized visually, and some additional values were eliminated by subjective evaluation. After automatic and subjective editing, 9% of the temperature, salinity and optical transmittance data and 31% of the fluorescence data were edited out of the final data set. Most of the bad fluorescence data came from the first year before self-cleaning fluorometers were installed.</para>

<para>ISUS nitrate concentration and associated data-quality parameters were sampled every 10 minutes to allow the ultraviolet bulb to last the length of the project. This instrument was newly developed and, to our knowledge, had not been used successfully in an underway system before. We developed three error thresholds based upon (a) the nitrate error estimate of the instrument, (b) the difference between its salinity estimate and the thermosalinograph salinity, and (c) the spectral average over the measurement wavelength band. These thresholds changed between deployments as the manufacturer improved the instrument. Observations degraded as the strength of the optical signal decreased due to fouling of the optics. The measurements bounced back after cleaning. Our data editing eliminated 23% of the data, but most of this was in the first year before the manufacturer found that particles shed from the shutter fouled the optics internally.</para>
<para>Problem and Resolution:</para>
<para>The concentration of dissolved nitrate, a phytoplankton nutrient, was measured with a Satlantic ISUS (in situ ultraviolet spectrophotometer) nitrate sensor employing optical ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy. This was the first commercially available oceanic nitrate sensor that did not use chemicals and their attendant monitoring and renewal to measure nitrate, and ours was one of the first applications of this technology to an underway sampling system. The instrument was set up to measure nitrate every 10 minutes. The ISUS worked well for the first day of deployment but soon failed to give correct values when the average spectral level dropped too low. We noticed rust stains on the probe tip and optical window. Manual cleaning helped a little, but the ISUS soon gave bad values again. It was sent to the manufacturer who replaced the probe tip and optical window. We added the sequence of 50- and 1-micrometer filters as mentioned in the subsection above to remove the rust in early April 2005. This solved the visible rust-staining problem, but the ISUS only operated correctly from 10 April to 4 May 2005 and then sporadically immediately after cleaning cycles. Following a presentation ((Cokelet, E. D., Jenkins, A. J., Pegau, W. S., Mordy, C. W., and Sullivan, M. E., 2005)) on the Tustumena system at the 2005 ASLO Summer Meeting, Friedhelm Schroeder of the GKSS Institute for Coastal Research, Germany, suggested that we clean the optical window with a cotton swab and oxalic acid (Schroeder, F. and Koch, M., 2005). We tried that on 19 July 2005, and the ISUS immediately began reporting realistic data. Commencing then, we added oxalic acid probe-tip cleaning to our routine maintenance protocol. Apparently an organic-iron-oxide film was forming on the probe tip. It was transparent to visible light, but opaque to ultraviolet light. Oxalic acid removed this film.</para>
<para>Calibration:</para>
<para>On calibration cruises, water samples were collected, frozen and sent to PMEL for nitrate analysis. Samples were collected in acid-cleaned 40 ml HDPE Boston Round sample bottles, triple rinsed from the underway seawater line. To prevent loss of sample due to expansion when freezing, a 1-2 cm air gap was left at the top of the sample bottle and samples were frozen in an upright position (Dore, J., Houlihan, T., Hebel, D., Tien, G., Tupas, L., and Karl, D., 1996). The majority of samples were analyzed at PMEL within 8 months, but some samples were analyzed 11 months after collection. Samples were thawed in a cool water bath and immediately analyzed. Nitrate and nitrite analyses were modified from Armstrong et al. (1967). Nitrate was reduced to nitrite in a cadmium column, and formed into a red azo dye by complexing nitrite with sulfanilamide and N-1-naphthylethylenediamine. The color formation of the dye was dependent on the concentration of nitrite, and was detected at 540 nanometer through a 10 millimeter flow cell. Because this technique measures nitrate plus nitrite, a second channel was used to measure only nitrite in the sample (the same technique was used without the reduction step), and nitrate was determined by difference. Nitrate and nitrite were measured using automated continuous flow analysis with a segmented flow and colorimetric detection. The twochannel autoanalyzer was customized using components from various systems. The major components were an Alpkem 301 sampler, a 24 channel Ismatek peristaltic pump, micro-coils and glass tubing from Irama Corp., two spectrophotometers from Fox Scientific, and custom software for digitally logging and processing the chromatographs. Standardization and analysis procedures specified by Gordon et al. (1994) were closely followed including calibration of lab ware, preparation of primary and secondary standards, and corrections for blanks and refractive index. Discrete nitrate determinations were precise to within 0.2 microM and accurate to better than 0.5 microM. manufacturer to apply this break-in procedure to future ISUS factory inspections. Following the shutter-dust cleaning, the ISUS calibration changed dramatically. In February 2008, the instrument was factory-checked and calibrated, but its field calibration did not change appreciably. The second linear least squares fit (NO3 = 1.30 NO3:ISUS-2.07) accounted for the same amount of variance (88%) with a similar standard error (1.29 microM) as before, but now the ISUS nitrate values bracketed the discrete calibration values along the blue dashed line of equality. Earlier, shutter dust on the lens had biased the ISUS nitrate values low. The results show that with field calibration, the ISUS nitrate is accurate to within 1.3 microM as compared to an accuracy of 0.5 microM for laboratory-analyzed discrete samples. Periodic probe-tip cleaning with oxalic acid was still required, even in the absence of shutter dust.</para>

<para>Instruments must be calibrated to ensure measurement accuracy. Typically Tustumena entered the shipyard for routine maintenance for over a month between late fall and early spring each year. We usually removed the instruments at that time and returned them to their manufacturers for checking, calibration and refurbishment. Several times each year, project personnel rode the ferry from Homer to Kodiak and back to extract discrete water samples from the sampling port for calibration purposes.</para>
<para>TEMPERATURE:</para>
<para>Ocean temperature was measured near the seawater intake with a remote digital thermometer.  Temperature bath calibrations provided by the manufacturer showed the  absolute mean residual error of the remote temperature sensor was 0.00035 degrees C, and it drifted less than 0.00052 degrees C/yr. This instrumental error is negligible compared to other sources of bias and the natural variability of the measurements. We estimate that the water warmed negligibly as it passed under the 90-meter-long hull at an average speed of 6.8 m/s (13 kt) requiring 13 seconds to reach the sea chest. It is difficult to estimate how much the water temperature changed as the water flowed from the seawater intake in its 1-inch-diameter (D = 2r = 2.54 cm) pipe for a length L (=176 cm) to the remote temperature sensor, but we can put an upper bound on that value. The average flow speed in the pipe (u) is given by the ratio of the volume flow rate ([3.3 L/min][1000 cm3/l][min/60 s] = 55 cm3/s) to the cross-sectional area (5.07 cm2) and equals 10.9 cm/s. The transit time from the sea chest to the temperature sensor was 16.2 s. The heat transfer from the water to the pipe to the surrounding air depends upon the Reynolds and Nusselt numbers of the flow, the pipe material and thickness, and the outer wall temperature (Lienhard, J. H., IV and Lienhard, J. H., V, 2008). The pipe-flow Reynolds number R (= uD/v where v is the kinematic viscosity of water = 0.0124 cm2/s), was 2200, which means that the flow was transitioning from laminar to turbulent. We used Lienhard and Lienhard (2008, Chapter 7) to compute the Nusselt number and the fluid heat transfer coefficient, hF = 240 W/m2K, at the deployment averaged temperature of 7 degrees C. The net heat transfer coefficient, h, of the system is given by the inverse of the mean inverse heat transfer coefficients for each step of the transfer process, i.e. 1/h = 1/hF + 1/hP + 1/hI where hw, hP and hI are the heat transfer coefficients for the water, pipe and insulation surrounding it. The heat transfer coefficient for the Cu-Ni pipe (Powell, C. A., 2010) is the ratio of its thermal conductivity (29 W/mK) to its wall thickness (5/32 inches = 3.97x10-3 m) which gives hP = 7300 W/m2K. The pipe was insulated by 3/8-inch-thick foam insulation with an R-value of 2 which by the definition of a US R unit (R = 0.176 Km2/W) gives hI = 2.84 W/m2K. The pipe insulation was not always fully in place, so the overall heat transfer coefficient, h, varied between 232 and 2.84 W/m2K depending upon the absence or presence of the insulation. The shaft alley temperature tended toward the sea temperature because it was below the water line and surrounded by water on three sides. The compartment was heated at times, but the seawater pipe was located below the floorboards near the hull of the ship. The bare pipe always felt cold to the touch owing to the cold water flowing in it. For the case of a bare pipe, we estimate that TW did not exceed T0 by more than 2 degrees C. In that case an upper limit on the temperature increase would be 0.26 degrees C. With the pipe insulation in tact, an extreme upper limit for the insulation outer wall temperature would be the room temperature, say 20 degrees C, and a lower limit for the inlet temperature would be 0 degrees C. Therefore, an upper bound on the temperature increase between the sea and the temperature sensor, would be 0.034 degrees C for insulated pipe. We do not know when the pipe insulation was in place or removed. As the temperature measurements show in the Results section of our analysis, a bias of 0.26 degrees C is small compared to temperature variability along the track of the ship and between years. A bias of 0.034 degrees C for insulated pipe is negligible.</para>
<para>SALINITY:</para>
<para>Ocean salinity was measured via thermosalinograph in the main instrument box. The thermosalinograph actually measures conductivity, which is corrected by the temperature at the measurement point to give salinity. When new or after refurbishment, the salinity sensors had negligible error at the factory. Post-deployment factory tests revealed drifts of -0.024 to -0.115 psu/year that were smaller than the natural variability encountered. These tests were used to show that the sensors were working correctly. For salinity calibration, water samples were collected from the underway system sampling port, stored in triple-rinsed 200-ml Kimax borosilicate bottles and analyzed in the laboratory with a Guildline Autosal laboratory salinometer. Thermosalinograph salinities measured at the time of water sampling were regressed against the bottle values as shown by the green line in Figure 6. The linear regression accounted for 96% of the variance. Based upon the students t score statistic, the slope of the fit was significantly different from zero with over 99% confidence. The thermosalinograph salinity was typically lower than the bottle salinity by about 0.185 psu as shown by the displacement of the green line from the blue dashed line along which the data points would lie if the samples from the two sources matched exactly. We cannot explain why there is a displacement, but by employing field observations we can correct for it.</para>
<para>ChlA:</para>
<para>The filters were placed in labeled microcentrifuge tubes and briefly frozen on the ship at -13 degrees C for later laboratory analysis. On land they were transferred to a -80 degrees C freezer for several months until extraction in 90% acetone for 24 hours. The fluorometric determination of chlorophyll concentration via the acidification method (Lorenzen, C., 1966) was made in the laboratory using a Turner Designs TD700 fluorometer calibrated with pure chlorophyll a. Based upon factory calibrations using a marine diatom (Thalassiorsira weissflogii) as a standard (WET Labs, 2004), the fluorescence voltages for the WET Labs instruments, FlChl, were related to the chlorophyll concentration, ChlFl via the factory-calibrated scale factor, SFChl, and dark voltage, Vref, by the following formula:  ChlFl = SFChl (FlChl -Vref). For each deployment year, we computed a linear least squares fit of the factory-calibrated chlorophyll versus the discrete sample concentration from calibration cruises. For the 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 deployments the standard errors of the fits were 2.16, 0.25, 0.85 and 1.17 micrograms/l. Students t-tests showed that each of the linear slopes was significantly different from zero with greater than 98% confidence, confirming the relationship between fluorescence and chlorophyll concentration. Also in no case did the 95% confidence limits of the slope encompass a line of slope 1, implying that the marine diatom fluorescence-chlorophyll relationship used by the factory did not represent the phytoplankton conditions that we encountered in the field. The 2005 WETStar and the 2006 ECO fluorometer fits were good, accounting for 74% and 75% of the variance. However the 2007 and 2008 ECO fluorometer fits were more scattered, accounting for only 14% and 16% of the variance. Unfortunately the calibration cruises sampled low chlorophyll concentrations (&lt; 8 micrograms/l) each year after 2005. Based upon the factory calibrations, the WETStar overestimated the chlorophyll concentration on average, whereas the ECO fluorometers underestimated it. The conversion of chlorophyll fluorescence measured from a moving ship to chlorophyll concentration is an imprecise process because the relationship depends upon the phytoplankton species, the condition of the cells, and their history of light exposure -- all of which depend upon location and time.</para>
<para>CDOM:</para>
<para>Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM, aka yellow substance) fluorescence was measured with fluorometers tuned to the CDOM excitation (370 nm) and emission wavelengths (460 nm). A WET Labs WETStar CDOM fluorometer requiring periodic cleaning was used until 30 July 2006 followed by a WET Labs ECO fluorometer with a bio-wiper that cleaned automatically. No discrete oceanic calibration samples were acquired. According to the manual by the manufacturer (WET Labs, 2004), the CDOM concentration in quinine sulfate dihydrate equivalence (ppb) is related to the fluorescence voltage output, FlCDOM, the factory calibrated scale factor, SFCDOM, and the instrument clean water offset, CWOCDOM, by the following formula:</para>
<para>CDOM = SFCDOM (FlCDOM - CWOCDOM).</para>
<para>Factory calibrations in March 2003, December 2004, July 2006, February 2007 and February 2008 provided values of SFCDOM and CWOCDOM that were used to convert the measured fluorescence voltage to CDOM concentration. In the end, the CDOM data from 2004-2006 were rejected because they were too noisy and contained unexplainable baseline shifts compared to the 2007 and 2008 data.</para>
<para>Particulate Concentration</para>
<para>Optical collimated beam attenuation over a 25-cm path length was measured with a WET Labs C-Star transmissometer at a wavelength of 660 nm, appropriate for measuring the light loss due to particle scattering. No discrete oceanic calibration samples were acquired to calibrate the transmissometer. According to the manufacturer manual (WET Labs, 2003), the transmittance, Tr, is related to the voltage output by the following formula: Tr = (V - Vdark)/(Vref - Vdark) where V is the output voltage, Vdark is the meter output when the light path is blocked and Vref is the meter output in clean water. Factory calibrations in November 2003, December 2004, June 2005, February 2007 and March 2008 provided values of Vdark and Vref that were used to convert the measured voltage to transmittance. Periods when Tr was near zero and the transmissometer was not working properly were excluded from the data set.</para>
<para>Unfortunately the transmissometer employed no self-cleaning mechanism, and its light level was a function of both the sediment load and the cleanliness of the optics. Therefore no direct inference could be made about the distribution of suspended sediment over the route of the ferry. Besides the seawater measurements, the transmissometer also ran during the automatic fresh-water backflushes that were performed during each port call, or whenever the control system sensed a need to backflush. The backflush transmittance behaved like the seawater curve, decreasing between manual cleanings. The backflush transmittance can be used as a reference value to remove the effects of fouling if one assumes that the potable fresh water had a relatively low and consistent particulate concentration.</para>
