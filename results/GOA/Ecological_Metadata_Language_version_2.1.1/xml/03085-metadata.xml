<abstract><para>Fishery productivity in an ecosystem is often linked to zooplankton production.  Zooplankton communities vary both temporally and spatially, thus extensive effort must be undertaken to describe their broader-scale and seasonal patterns.  Once baselines are established, zooplankton communities can become sensitive indicators of environmental conditions.  Thus, long-term observations on planktonic communities may be the key to understanding how marine environments, and the higher trophic levels dependent on them, change over time.  Furthermore, understanding the feeding environment of juvenile pink salmon when they first enter the ocean may allow hatchery-reared pink salmon to be released coincident with favorable zooplankton conditions.  ZooImage was  used to process zooplankton and phytoplankton samples from seven salmon hatcheries in PWS between 1981 and 1999.  The standing stock for zooplankton and phytoplankton samples was determined for two different stations at each hatchery, one in the bay immediately adjacent to the hatchery and one in the passage immediately adjacent to the hatchery.</para>

  <methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Sample Collection</title>
 <para>For this project we used samples collected by Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corporation (Cordova, AK) at the Armin F. Koernig (AFK), Wally H. Noerenburg (WNH), Main Bay (MBH), Cannery Creek (CCH), Solomon Gulch (SGH), Port Graham (PGH), and Port Chalmers (PC) hatcheries.  Zooplankton and phytoplankton were collected using a 0.5 m diameter, 0.25 m mesh unmetered ring-net hauled vertically from 20 m depth to the surface.  Samples consisted of 1-3 pooled vertical tows.  If the number of tows was not recorded, then 2 tows was assumed for calculating the total volume filtered.  Volume filtered was calculated as the product of net mouth area and depth, assuming 100% filtration efficiency.  All samples were stored in 5-10% formalin seawater until processed.  Temperature was recorded at each station at a depth of 1 m.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Sample Processing</title>
 <para>Samples were split with a combination of a 50-mL Stempel pipette and, as necessary, with a beaker split to yield samples of 500-2000 biological particles.  All samples were scanned on an Epson Perfection 4990 Photo color flatbed scanner to which a 20x25x2.8 cm acrylic box-frame was attached.  The sub-sample to be scanned was strained, diluted to 250 mL with filtered seawater and placed into the frame for scanning.  To improve accuracy in identification, particles were superficially arranged to reduce the number of particles touching each other or the edges of the frame.  All zooplankton images were evaluated with ZooImage, a computer assisted plankton image analysis software package which utilizes ImageJ, R statistical software and machine learning algorithms to create zooplankton training sets to assist with image recognition (see Bell and Hopcroft, 2008 for more complete software description).  All image acquisition and processing was conducted using a 3.2 GHz computer with a Pentium IV processor and 4 GB of RAM.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Determination of Abundance and Biomass</title>
 <para>ZooImage identified each particle in a sample according to a training set created using 53 distinct plankton categories and Random Forest machine learning algorithms to teach the software.  In addition to identification, ZooImage calculated abundance (ind. m-3) of plankton categories in each sample based on the fraction of the sample scanned and the volume of water sampled. ZooImage then calculated biomass (mg m-3) of plankton categories using the ECD (equivalent circular diameter) computed by ZooImage during image analysis.  Conversions from the standard zooplankton measurements (e.g., prosome length) to ECD were established so that published length-weight relationships for local zooplankton taxa could be employed in biomass calculations.</para>
 <para>Length measurements for biomass calculations were obtained with PlanktonJ.  PlanktonJ is a routine available in ZooImage that allows the user to work within the software to obtain basic measurements (e.g., prosome length) of the particles from the vignettes.  Additionally, PlanktonJ used the metadata associated with each vignette and updated it with the new measurements.  Biomass was only calculated for dominant species within the zooplankton samples (i.e., 42 biomass categories compared to 48 abundance categories); these categories do not include discard groups such as debris, marine snow and phytoplankton that make up the complete training set.  In total, ZooImage produced abundance and biomass estimates in seasonal time-series for each hatchery that contained between 19-52 zooplankton samples.</para>
