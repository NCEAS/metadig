 <abstract><para>MDN and delivered by salmon and other anadromous fishes are considered important drivers in riverine ecosystems, providing nutrients and food to these land-based food webs. However, we know little about the relative value of MDN compared to other nutrient and carbon sources (e.g., watershed-derived) in the Gulf of Alaska region. The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as &#969;3:&#969;6. Based on our data the development of a nutrient proxy for estimating salmon escapement shows some promise in certain situations, but is unlikely in the majority of salmon streams in southcentral Alaska.

 <methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Study Area</title>
 <para>The southern part of the Kenai Peninsula, bounded by Cook Inlet to the west and the Caribou Hills to the east has gently rolling topography, with wide river valleys and extensive peat wetland systems. Elevations range from around 950 meters to sea level. Climate in the study area is transitional between maritime and continental, in general becoming more continental towards the north. Homer, located at the southern end of the Peninsula, has an average winter (January) temperature of &#8211;5.2  degC and average summer (July) temperatures of 11.9 degC. The average annual precipitation in Homer is 61.7cm, with the majority of rain occurring in fall (September through November). Snowmelt and ice breakup contribute to high stream flows in spring (April-May) (Mauger 2005).</para>
 <para>The southern Peninsula supports many wildlife species including a wide variety of seabirds, waterfowl, shorebirds, raptors, and songbirds, moose, black and brown bears, fox, lynx, coyote, and a variety of small mammals. The streams in this area support numerous small fish and salmonid species including king (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), silver (O. kisutch), steelhead (O. mykiss) pink and Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma).</para>
 <para>The economic base for communities on the southern Peninsula is largely composed of commercial fishing, sport fishing and tourism. Land ownership in the area includes Federal, Native Corporation, State, Borough and private holdings. Land use on the southern Kenai Peninsula has changed dramatically over the past 15 years, especially due to increased forest practices in response to the spruce bark beetle epidemic, and to increased development activities associated with a growing population. Population growth is expected to continue (KBRR and NOAA/CSC 2001).</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Developing Monitoring Techniques for MDN in Stream Food Webs</title>
 <para>We began the project with pilot investigations in year one conducted in two watersheds on the southern Peninsula. The two chosen watersheds are similar geomorphically, and with respect to human land uses and wetland extent. The treatment watershed, the North Fork and Chakok tributaries of the Anchor River, is 283 square kilometers, while the control watershed, Happy Valley Creek, is 28 square kilometers (Baird and Walker 2004). The Anchor River system supports anadromous runs of king, silver, and steelhead, as well as anadromous and resident populations of Dolly Varden. The Happy Valley System has resident Dolly Varden, but no anadromous runs due to the presence of a waterfall near the mouth of the creek.</para>
 <para>In year one, investigations were conducted in the two pilot watersheds by establishing five sampling stations along the river continuum extending from mouth to headwaters, representing a hypothesized MDN gradient. Each station included approximately 200 meters of stream. Sampling was done three times per year; prior to the initiation of spawning runs in the spring (May), after the king salmon run (July) and after the silver salmon run in the fall (end of October). The spring sampling enabled us to capture residual effects of MDN from the previous years&#8217; runs, and the fall sampling enabled us to examine the importance of MDN resulting from the current year, prior to overwintering. In year one, we also explored sampling potential effects of MDN into nearshore environments by examining nutrient outflow from the two systems.</para>
 <para>The Anchor River has a short mainstem (approximately 2 km) near the ocean, and then divides into the North Fork and South Fork. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game operates a sonar station and weir on the mainstem, below the divide. ADFG has not escapement to the forks separately, but estimates that the North Fork captures 25-40% of the salmon that enter the river (Nicky Szarzi pers. comm.). In year one, we established a weir on the North Fork of the Anchor River. We used the weir to measure escapement through all salmon runs beginning May 15 and extending through September 15.</para>
 <para>To assess the incorporation of MDN in food webs, we collected samples of fish (Dolly Varden and sculpin; n = 10), macroinvertebrates (focusing on dominant species and including species representing functional feeding groups), riparian vegetation (willow and horsetail), collecting enough sample material to allow for all tissue analyses, and water chemistry samples at each station.</para>
 <para>In year one, we attempted to sample water chemistry, algal chlorophyll production and biomass in the nearshore environment of each system by placing bricks in replicates in five locations within each stream, ranging from the extent of high tide to the mouth, and placed buoys outfitted with settling plates at a distance into the Inlet. However, these efforts were thwarted by high sedimentation rates due to longshore transport and the use of the stream mouth areas as fishing areas (moorings were removed and algal collection bricks ended up in campfire rings), therefore we decided to abandon the nearshore sampling effort in subsequent years as the confounding difficulties appeared to make long term monitoring efforts impractical in this environment. We also made an attempt to record the biota (presence and abundance) in the nearshore environment using underwater video, however the wave energy in the vicinity stirred up the particulate matter such that we could not get a clear image.</para>
 <para>Following our investigations in the two pilot watersheds in year one, we expanded our sampling efforts to nine watersheds in three different regions: (1) Cooper Landing, (2) north side of Kachemak Bay, and (3) the south side of Kachemak Bay in order to investigate potential differences in response to MDN in watersheds with different underlying geology. The Cooper Landing and south side of Kachemak Bay watersheds drain systems with nutrient-poor underlying parent geology and the north side of Kachemak Bay sites are characterized by underlying nutrient-rich geology, as noted by high levels of ambient P (Mauger 2005). Otherwise, all systems are similar to the extent possible (i.e., similar basin area, elevation, channel slope, climate, geomorphology and surrounding land use. One salmon-free reference stream and two salmon spawning streams were sampled in each region. The reference streams allowed us to ensure that any signal we saw in stream food webs is truly a response to MDN and not attributable to natural variability in the system. Performing the same tests in systems with and without anadromous salmon runs allowed us to determine whether the proposed methods were clearly measuring the effects of MDN. The Cooper Landing set consisted of the Russian River and Quartz Creek as salmon-bearing streams and Juneau Creek as the salmon-free reference. Juneau Creek has a waterfall approximately 3 km upstream of its confluence with the Kenai River which blocks salmon access to most of the basin. The north side of Kachemak Bay set consisted of the North Fork of the Anchor River and the South Fork of the Anchor River as the salmon-bearing streams and Happy Valley Creek as the salmon-free reference. The south side of Kachemak Bay set consisted of Humpy Creek, Barabara Creek, and China Poot Creek. China Poot Creek supports a terminal run of sockeye in the lower reaches, however upstream progress is blocked by a waterfall less than 2 km from the mouth. Sockeye fry are stocked in China Poot Lake, and the lake is fertilized regularly to support the fry. We sampled China Poot Creek above the lake.</para>
 <para>In each watershed, we sampled three locations along the stream continuum; one station at the headwaters, above any salmon spawning; one station midway from the headwaters to the outlet; and one station near the stream outlet. The three stations represented a hypothesized MDN gradient, from high MDN influence near the mouth of the streams to lower MDN influence near the headwaters. Specific sample site selection for the upstream sites was based on water depth (less than one meter), stream substrate (gravels/cobbles), and accessibility (trails, landowner permission, etc.).</para>
 <para>Our main objectives for years two and three were to (1) examine the ability of various stable isotope and fatty acid measures of MDN assimilation in stream-resident fishes to differentiate among sites that vary in the number of spawning salmon and (2) understand the relationships among these measures.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Fish Sampling and processing</title>
 <para>Fish were collected using minnow traps that were baited with salmon eggs enclosed in a perforated whirlpak bag, and deployed appropriately, where the current was slow enough for juvenile fish to enter the traps. The traps were checked after one hour, and left for up to 24 hours, depending on fishing success. The fish were placed live in large whirlpak bags marked with the station name and date, and filled with stream water. The fish bags were then placed in buckets or a cooler with ice and transported to the laboratory the same day. In the case of overnight sampling trips, captured fish were stored in liquid nitrogen dewars until delivery to the laboratory the following day.</para>
 <para>In the laboratory, fish samples were weighed and fork-length measured in the laboratory to calculate fish condition factor (Fulton Condition Factor K = mass/length3). Stomach contents were removed from fish via gastric lavage, and the contents were placed in ethanol in individual whirlpak bags, labeled with fish identification, station identification, and date. Fish stomach contents were analyzed for the proportion of marine, terrestrial, and freshwater content based on volume in order to determine relative amounts of marinesourced food the fish are consuming.</para>
 <para>The fish were then frozen in a minus 70 degree freezer until being shipped in an insulated freezer box to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Auke Bay Laboratory in Juneau for lipid and fatty acid analysis. At the Auke Bay Lab, the fish were homogenized individually and half of each fish, by volume, was shipped back to the Kachemak Bay Research Reserve (KBRR). At KBRR, the fish were oven dried, pulverized, prepped for stable isotope analysis, before being sent to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) stable isotope laboratory in Denver, Colorado.</para>

 <para>Water samples were collected for analysis of ammonium, nitrate, total N, particulate and dissolved inorganic C, particulate and dissolved organic C, orthophosphate, soluble P and total reactive P using standard procedures on a monthly basis (American Public Health Association 1995). The samples were held on ice for transport and hand delivered to the Cook Inlet Water Quality Laboratory in Homer, AK.</para>
 <para>Stream discharge curves were developed for each station by measuring the cross-sectional velocity of the stream over a wide range of flow conditions at one of the sample sites. The sample site for stream discharge measurement will be chosen based on channel morphology.</para>

 <methodStep><description><section><title>Invertebrate and Plant Sampling</title>
 <para>Stream macroinvertebrates were collected by a combination of kick-net, drift-net and hand picking off of woody debris and stones. Macroinvertebrates were sorted in the field and directly picked into pre-labeled 2-mL polypropylene vials. Two full 2-mL vials were collected for each species. Field notes included the number of individuals in each sample and any information on instar stage. Several representatives of each taxon were preserved for later identification (or confirmation) using standard taxonomic keys. One portion of each was oven dried, pulverized and prepped for stable isotope analysis before being sent to the USGS stable isotope laboratory in Denver, Colorado. One portion was frozen in a minus 70 degree freezer until shipped in an insulated freezer box to the Auke Bay Laboratorty for lipid and fatty acid analysis.</para>
 <para>Riparian vegetation leaves were picked and placed in a plastic bag, labeled with station identification, site number and date. Leaves were oven dried, pulverized and then shipped to the USGS stable isotope laboratory in Denver, Colorado for analysis.</para>
