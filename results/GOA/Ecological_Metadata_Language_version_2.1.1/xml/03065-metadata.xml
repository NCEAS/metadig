<abstract><para>Study History: The purpose of this study was to characterize the basic ecology, distribution, and demographics of sand lance in lower Cook Inlet. Recent declines of upper trophic level species in the northern Gulf of Alaska have been linked to decreasing availability of forage fishes. Sand lance is the most important forage fish in most nearshore areas of the northern Gulf. Despite its importance to commercial fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, little is known or published on the basic biology of this key prey species. Therefore, restoration project /306 was established to work in coordination with restoration APEX project /163M to help characterize the relationship between seabird population dynamics and forage fish abundance. 

Abstract: Distinct sand lance populations occur within the relatively small geographic area of Lower Cook Inlet, Alaska. Marked meso-scale differences in abundance, growth, and mortality exist as a consequence of differing oceanographic regimes. Growth rate within populations (between years) was positively correlated with temperature. However, this did not extend to inter-population comparisons where differing growth rates were better correlated to marine productivity. Most sand lance reached maturity in their second year. Field observations and indices of maturity, gonad development, and ova-size distribution all indicated that sand lance spawn once each year. Sand lance spawned intertidally in late September and October on fine gravel/sandy beaches. Embryos developed over 67 days through periods of intertidal exposure and sub-freezing air temperatures. Mean dry-weight energy value of sand lance cycles seasonally, peaking in spring and early summer, and subsequently declining by about 25% during late summer and fall. Sand lance enter the winter with close to their minimum whole body energy content.

 <para>Sand lance were sampled at three areas in Lower Cook Inlet: Kachemak Bay, Chisik Island, and the Barren Islands. These areas were chosen because we were concurrently conducting studies on seabirds that breed in each area. We collected sand lance from intertidal substrates and by beach seine (Robards et al., 1999a). Adult sand lance were collected in February, and then monthly from June to November in Kachemak Bay. We confirmed adults collected in October were in pre- spawning condition by the appearance of gonads and field observations. Adults were collected from Chisik Island and the Barren Islands during July. Juvenile sand lance were collected only from Kachemak Bay.</para>
 <para>Sand lance were measured (fork length, mm), blotted dry, weighed (+/-0.01 g), individually bagged, and frozen. Gonads were excised from partially-thawed individuals to prevent their rupture. Ovaries and testes were identified using a dissecting microscope and weighed (+/-0.001 g). Gonads were retained with the rest of the body for proximate analysis.</para>
 <para>Sagittal otoliths were collected ventrally to the spinal column and anterior to a transverse incision made at the posterior margin of the skull (visible through the skin). Otoliths were cleaned of fibrous tissue, and stored dry in Epindorf tubes for later analysis. The left otolith was mounted on a microscope slide in the sagittal plane using CrystalBond thermal resin. Age determinations were based on the otolith interpretations of Macer (1966) and Scott (1973). Based on January 1 hatch date (Dick &amp; Warner, 1982), first year sand lance were designated as age group-0, second- year sand lance as age group-1, up to the seventh-year as age group-6. These age groups were divided into juveniles (group-0; sexually immature) and adults (groups 1 - 6; sexually mature; Robards et al., 1999b).</para>
 <para>Adult sand lance were processed individually for proximate composition, whereas juveniles were analyzed in batches of 10 (5 mm size classes) because of their small size. Two replicates were made for each size class. Sand lance were dried at 60 degreesC to constant mass and reweighed to determine water content. Lipid content of dry samples was determined by solvent extraction using a soxhlet apparatus and a solvent system of 7: 2 hexane/isopropyl alcohol (Radin, 1981). Lean dry samples were ashed in a muffle furnace to determine ash-free lean dry mass (AFLDM). AFLDM is 94% protein (Montevecchi et al., 1984), and hereafter referred to as protein. Energy density (kJ/g dry mass) and energy content (kJ/fish) were calculated from proximate composition (water, lipid, ash-free lean dry matter, and ash), using published energy equivalents (lipid = 39.3 kJ/g, protein = 17.8 kJ/g; Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997). In response to frequent calls for standardization of results (e.g., Montevecchi and Piatt, 1984; Hislop et al., 1991 ; Van Pelt et al., 1997) we report results as kJ/g dry mass. All dry mass: wet mass relationships passed through the origin. We include slope parameters to allow calculation of kJ/g wet mass in Table I.</para>
 <para>A modified monthly gonadosomatic index (GSI; Nikolsky, 1963) was used to quantify seasonality of reproduction for stages 1 through 6 where GSI = (gonad weight/gonad-free body weight) x 100. Condition of sand lance in relation to wet, dry, lipid, and protein mass were calculated using a modified Fulton condition factor (K') proposed by Bagenal and Tesch (1978) where K' = mass x 10^7/(length)^3. We used the Student t- test to compare energetic values between sexes, time periods, and regions.</para>

 <para>Kachemak Bay is situated at the southern tip of the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska (59.61 7N, 15 1.450W). The bay is approximately 38km wide at its entrance and 62km long. Depths in the bay are relatively shallow ranging from about 35 to 90m, with depths generally deeper on the southern side of the bay. Water entering the bay is largely oceanic, originating from the Gulf of Alaska via the Kennedy entrance at the southern end of the Kenai Peninsula. Observations of spawning occurred at Raby's Spit (59.413N, 15 1.71 8W) located in Seldovia Bay at the southern entrance to Kachemak Bay.</para>
 <para>We made two comparative collections of adult sand lance during the summer at Chisik Island (60.142N, 152.596W) located approximately 90km northwest in Cook Inlet, and from Eleanor Island located in central Prince William Sound (60.533N, 147.600W).</para>
 <para>Water temperatures were measured using remote temperature loggers (Optic StowAway version 2.02, Onset Computer Corporation). The loggers were programmed to read water temperature every 10 minutes and placed at 3m depth (below low low water) on the south side of Kachemak Bay (permanent placement) and at Raby's Spit (only during spawning/incubation period of 1996). Air temperatures were collected in Homer by the Alaska Climate Center.</para>
 <para>Fish were collected primarily by beach seines, or by digging in intertidal substrates. Beach seining utilized a 44m long variable mesh beach seine. The net had 4m deep, 3mm knotless nylon stretch mesh (sm) for the middle 15.3m and tapered to 2.3m deep with 13mm knotless nylon sm wings. Thirty meters of rope were attached to each end of the seine for use in deployment. The net was set parallel to shore at a distance of 25m as described by Caillet et al. (1986). Samples were collected approximately every two weeks from May to September and once per month through the winter during during 1996 and 1997. Spawning schools were caught by setting the beach seine at a tangent from the beach and closing the open end when sand lance swam into the net. Sand lance collections made by digging in exposed intertidal substrates during negative tides (below chart datum) occurred approximately once per month through the year. No samples were collected in January due to field conditions.</para>
 <para>A total of 3,189 sand lance were collected in Kachemak Bay. No adult sand lance were caught by beach seine in the winter (November to March), these fish only being found in exposed intertidal sediments. Sand lance were immediately measured to fork length (mm), blotted dry, weighed (+/-0.01 g), individually bagged, and frozen. Gonads were excised from only partially thawed individuals preventing their rupture, particularly in later developmental stages. Gonads were identified as ovaries or testes using a dissecting microscope, weighed (+/-0.001g), and further classified microscopically as stage 0- immature, stage I- resting (based on Nelson and Ross, 1991), or stage II-developing, stage III- ripe, stage IV- running, stage V- spent, and stage VI- recovering (based on Macer, 1966).</para>
 <para>Fecundity was calculated using stratified (by 5mm size classes from 90 to 200mm) samples of 51 stage-II ovaries collected in August and September. Ovaries were carefully removed from fresh fish and preserved in 5% formalin which hardened ova. Before counting, ovaries were placed in small tubes and vigorously shaken with boiling water which resulted in the freeing of eggs from ovarian tissue. All eggs from both ovaries were individually counted on a partitioned petri-dish using a dissecting microscope. We also collected 150 eggs from each of 30 ripe (stage-III) females, 100 eggs from a spawning pit on Raby's Spit (10/12/96), and 78 eggs on subsequent visits to the spawning site (10/24/96, 11/25/96, and 12/9/96). These were analyzed immediately while being kept moist in seawater to prevent desiccation. Eggs were measured using an ocular micrometer at 40x magnification. Embryo development was based on the classification into six stages as outlined by Smigielski et al. (1984).</para>
 <para>We aged a sub-sample (2,800) of the fish collected in Kachemak Bay and all fish from the two comparative sites. Sagital otoliths were removed from the saculus using fine forceps after making a transverse incision behind the skull. Fibrous material was removed from otoliths which were then cleared and bonded to microscope slides using crystalbond thermal resin. We determined ages on two separate occasions using the methodology of Macer (1966) and Scott (1973). Otoliths with poorly defined annuli that could not be confirmed using the second otolith or where disagreement occurred between readings were omitted from the dataset. Age designations are based on a 1 January hatch date with first year fish designated as age group-0 and second year fish as age group 1, up to seventh year fish being classified as age group-6.</para>
 <para>Approximately 3kg of substrate was collected from each of three spawn sites on Raby's Spit. Samples were dried at 65 degreesC until no change in mass was observed. The sample for each site was sieved through 16mm, 8mm, 4mm, 2mm, 1mm, 0.5mm, 0.25mm, 0.125mm, and 0.063mm sieves. Percent mass of substrate retained by each sieve was calculated. Particle sizes were classified according to the Wentworth scale in phi units, where phi = -log2, diameter (mm). Median particle diameter is the diameter corresponding to the 50% mark on the cumulative curve using a probability transformed Y-axis (Brown and McLachlan, 1990).</para>
 <para>A modified gonadosomatic index (GSI) was used to quantify seasonality of reproduction on sexed individuals of stages-I through VI. All immature (stage-0) fish were omitted from this calculation. The GSI was calculated as: GSI = (gonad weight/gonad-free body weight) x 100 (Nikolsky, 1963; Cuellar et al., 1996).</para>
 <para>To compare the length/weight relationships between sexes, we compared the slope and intersect of linear regressions statistically using the Chow test (Salvanes and Stockley, 1996). Mann-Whitney rank sum tests were used to evaluate differences between length at age for the different sexes and between different groups of GSI values. A chi-square test was used to assess deviation from a hypothetical 50:50 sex ratio.</para>

 <entityDescription>This file lists all the length (mm) and weight (g) data from individual fish captured in beachseines.  The file is arranged so that each worksheet contains data from a single year, from 1995 to 1999.  Each row is a single fish, and columns list investigator, station name, common fish name, fish species code (in 1998-1999), fork length (mm), and weight (g).  In 1998 and 1999, a subsample of the measured fish were weighed; therefore, there are some empty cells in the weight columns.    From 1995 to 1997, Martin Robards was the investigator.  Fish were weighed and measured by hand the same day as captured.  An Ohaus electronic scale was used for weights. **Martin, I added these data from files you gave me a few years ago.  Please format them and make sure all data are presented in these 3 kbay worksheets from 1995-97. From 1998 to 1999, Alisa Abookire was the investigator. Fish were we measured with an electronic fish measuring board to the nearest 1 mm, and weights were taken with an electric Ohaus scale.  Similarly, all fish were processed the same day as capture. **Martin, please add length/weight data from Chisik 1996, 1997, and 1999. Also add the additional kbay sand lance which you mentioned you had (several thousand fish?) Art Kettle needs to add Barrens length/weight data from all years.</entityDescription>
