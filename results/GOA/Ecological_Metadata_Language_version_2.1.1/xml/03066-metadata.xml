<abstract><para>Study History: This investigation was initiated with a detailed study plan that subsequently became Fish/Shellfish Study Number 27. The initial research plan coupled parallel investigations on Kenai/Skilak Lakes in Cook Inlet with Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island. A final report on F/S No. 27 was published by D.C. Schmidt and K.E. Tarbox within the Fisheries Rehabilitation, Enhancement and Development Report series (No. 136) titled Sockeye Salmon Overescapement. Subsequent studies (93002, 94258, 95258, 96258 and 97251) focused on restoration efforts which consisted of continued monitoring of the affected populations with an interim ADF&amp;G Regional Information Report (No. 5J95-15) published by Schmidt et al. (1995). The data collected from Kodiak Archipelago sockeye populations were included in these reports while publications focused solely upon Kodiak Island sockeye data with limited analyses have also been generated: Barrett et al. (1993a, 1993b); Swanton and Nelson (1995); Swanton et al. (1996). 

Abstract: The impacts of large escapements on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) systems with freshwater production constrained by limitations on lake rearing capacity were substantiated with empirical data for several Alaskan stocks. As a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island received escapements that were 2X the upper end of the escapement goals. Data collected were macrozooplankton biomass, species composition and size structure along with abundance and size of rearing fry and smolt. Two sockeye salmon systems, Upper Station and Frazer lakes, were used as controls. Zooplankton density and biomass decreased at both Red and Akalura lakes when fry from the 1989 brood year were present, however only the decrease for Akalura Lake sockeye was statistically significant. Rearing fry population estimates for both study lakes were deemed of low utility owing to numerous instances where they were less then subsequent smolt population estimates. Sockeye smolts from the 1989-1991 brood years exhibited increased percentages of age-2 fish alluding to the rearing environment having been impacted by heightened foraging of rearing fry. These results although not definitive, suggest that a depression in the rearing environment was caused by the 1989 escapement event and persisted through 1992.</para>

 <para>The Kodiak commercial salmon fishery management area spans the entire Kodiak Archipelago from Shuyak Island to the Trinity Islands (southern boundary) inclusive of the Alaska Peninsula from the northern boundary at Cape Douglas to Kilokak Rocks. This area is comprised of seven districts and 52 sections with five species of pacific salmon commercially harvested. There are 39 documented systems that support sockeye salmon populations of various sizes, of which four systems (Karluk, Ayakulik-Red River, Upper Station, and Frazer) generate greater than 85% of the area wide production (Swanton and Nelson 1996).</para>
 <para>Red Lake located on the southwest end of Kodiak Island is 6.4 km long with a surface area of 8.4 km2 and volume of 208x10^6 m3 (Honnold 1993). The Upper Station system is comprised of two adjoining lakes: Upper (7.9 km2 surface area) and Lower Olga (6.1 km2  surface area; Swanton 1992). These lakes are physically and productively dissimilar. Upper Olga is larger in surface area, 7m higher in elevation while Lower Olga Lake resembles Akalura Lake with a 4.9 km2 surface area, mean depth of 9.9m and elevation of 17m above sea level. Frazer Lake (14.6 km long and 1.6 km wide) is second in overall size to Karluk Lake on Kodiak Island with a surface area of 6.7 km2 and volume of 557x10^6 m3 (Blackett 1979).</para>

 <para>Escapements of sockeye salmon were estimated by weirs at Red, Upper Station, and Akalura lakes. Weir counts are used in conjunction with commercial catch data to manage the sockeye salmon fisheries of Kodiak. Adult scales were collected for age analysis from the fishery and fish collection devices near the sites where escapements were enumerated.</para>

 <para>smolt AWL</para>
 <para>1990 - 1995:</para>
 <para>The total number (with 95% confidence intervals) of sockeye salmon smolt migrating from each of the lake systems in 1990 to 1995 was estimated by a mark-recapture technique (Rawson 1984). Estimated size and age of sockeye salmon smolts was compared by brood year. Smolt were collected from traps of various designs. At weekly intervals, a sample of fish was marked with Bismark Brown dye and released upstream. Recovery rates of the dyed fish were used to estimate trap efficiency. The efficiency rate was then applied to estimate the total smolt migration. Methods deviated slightly each year but specific details of sampling are available in Barrett et al. (1993a) for the Kodiak lakes, in King et al. (1991, 1994a) for the Kenai River, and in Kyle (1992) for the Kasilof River. King et al. (1994b) describe the procedures used to estimate smolt abundance in the years prior to 1993. Subsamples of smolts from Kodiak Island were stored frozen and sent to the University of Alaska in Fairbanks to determine the relative levels of marine versus terrestrial nitrogen from selected Kodiak Island systems. These samples were taken to determine the effects of carcass nutrient additions in maintaining the productivity of Red Lake.</para>
 <para>1996:</para>
 <para>The Red Lake sockeye smolt enumeration site was located approximately 1.6 km downstream of the lake outlet where a single Canadian Fan Trap (Ginetz 1977) was deployed in 1990 (Barrett et al. 1993). During 1991-1996 two traps were operated (~6 May &#8211; 30 June) in tandem, the second trap was a modified incline plane trap (Todd 1994). The traps were connected together with an inverted V-shaped structure constructed of perforated plate; trap capture widths were 1.5 m and 2.0 m. During 1992 a total smolt enumeration weir located 30 m downstream of the traps was operated (Barrett et al. 1993a). Including the trap and attached leads, the effective capture width represented ~35% of the overall stream width.</para>
 <para>The Akalura Lake smolt site was located ~5.6 km downstream of the lake outlet and 0.4 km from the ocean. A single Canadian fan trap was operated (4 May-30 June 1990-1995; Swanton et al. 1996) which spanned 4 m or 31% of the wetted stream width. A total smolt weir was operated in concert with the smolt trap during 1996 (Coggins 1997). Upper Station was initially selected as a control system for overescapement studies; after the 1993 season, Frazer Lake became the control. The smolt trapping site was located 1.2 km downstream from the outlet of Lower Olga Lake. A single modified incline plane trap with perforated plate leads was operated annually from 4 May through approximately 9 August 1990-1993 (Barrett et al. 1993b). General site characteristics included water velocity greater than 0.3m/sec, average stream depth of 0.4 m, and a trap capture width of 4.5 m (39% of the stream width).</para>
 <para>Frazer Lake replaced Upper Station as the control system during 1994. During preceding years two smolt traps, an incline plane and permanent concrete trap were operated below the barrier falls; however trap catches were treated as abundance indices not total smolt estimates (Barrett 1988). For the 1994 season the incline plane trap was moved above the falls 76m upstream of the fish pass facility (Swanton et al. 1996). The trap capture width including perforated plate leads was 5m or 20% of the total stream width.</para>
 <para>Typically all smolt traps were inspected every 30 to 45 minutes from 2130 to 0400 h and during daylight hours every 3-4 h. Inspections consisted of enumeration and release of all catch by species, except when age-weight-length (AWL) or trap efficiency trials were scheduled. Fish species identification was made using visual examination of external characteristics (McConnell and Snyder 1972; Trautman 1973). Smolt enumeration was completed using direct visual counts; the exception being use of a catchweight approach when catches within a 3 h period exceeded &gt; 10,000 smolts (Barrett et al. 1993b). All catches were recorded by sampling day which extended from noon to noon. At each location, up to 70 sockeye salmon smolts were sampled daily for AWL data 5 days per week. To alleviate sampling bias, all fish in the live-box were mixed prior to sampling. Each sampled fish was anesthetized with MS-222 and a preferred area scale smear removed (INPFC 1963); fish weights (to 0.1 g) and lengths (to nearest 1.0 mm) were also recorded.</para>
 <para>Smolt trap capture efficiency was estimated using mark-recapture trials scheduled on a weekly basis. At all sites except Frazer Lake, about 500 smolts were marked and released about 1 km upstream of the trap site. At Frazer Lake, historical indices of trap capture efficiencies were low &lt; 0.5 % and a sample size of 1,000 marked fish was targeted. The mark-recapture process consisted of obtaining a random sample (preferably smolts captured in a single night), transport to a release site, and immersion in a 1,267 ppm Bismark Brown Y-dye solution for 1 h (Ward and Verhoeven 1963; Lawler and Fitz-Earle 1968), and placing them in an instream recovery live box for 1-1.5 h. After recovery, fish were released evenly across the stream channel at about 2200hrs. Smolts exhibiting signs of stress or abnormal behavior were destroyed. All trap catches were inspected for marked fish for a minimum of three successive nights after being liberated.</para>
 <para>1997:</para>
 <para>During 1997, a single Canadian fan trap was operated from 30 April through 12 June approximately 5.6 km downstream of the Akalura Lake outlet. The trap was equipped with a flow through livebox measuring 1.5 m long, 1 m wide, and 0.8 m high. Perforated-plate leads were attached to the trap opening extending 1.3 m towards the left stream bank and 1.9 m to the right bank. The lead to the right bank was attached to the stream bank and prohibited smolt passage on this side of the trap. The leads and trap opening spanned approximately 30% of the stream width. Additionally, a second trap (referred to as the weir) was installed and fitted with leads spanning the remaining portion of the stream. Collectively, the weir and trap captured 100% of outmigrant smolt. References made to weir catches throughout the remainder of this document are the sum of the weir and trap catches, or the total smolt outmigration. Due to the near completion of the smolt outmigration by June 12, the trap was removed and the right bank lead of the weir extended fully to the right bank. This weir configuration continued to enumerate smolt until June 25.</para>
 <para>The 1997 trap/weir configuration was modified slightly from the 1996 configuration because it was suspected that the right bank weir lead may have been influencing trap efficiency excessively during 1996.</para>
 <para>Smolt enumeration was completed by individual species counts as fish were removed from the liveboxes; an exception was when smolt capture rates exceeded the crew's ability (&gt; 10,000 fish per hour) to hand tally fish and a catch-weight method was instituted. The catch-weight method was conducted by transferring the catch by dip net to a small mesh basket attached to a spring scale suspended over the stream by an A-frame support; each dip net load was individually weighed, with fish immediately released into the stream downstream of the traps. Approximately every tenth dip net load was sampled to determine species count by weight. This entailed counting by species a dipnet load of fish into a water filled container, transferring the catch to a netted basket suspended from a scale for weighing, and then releasing the fish downstream of the trap site. All catch-weights were recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg. Species identification was made by visual examination of external characteristics (McConnell and Snyder 1972; Trautman 1973).</para>
 <para>All catch-weight data were recorded by sampling day which extended from noon to noon and was identified by calendar day of the noon to midnight period.</para>
 <para>Up to 70 sockeye salmon smolt were sampled daily for age, and length (AWL), five days a week (dependent upon smolt availability). To minimize bias, all fish in the live-box were stirred immediately before being removed for sampling. Each sampled fish was anesthetized with MS-222 and scale smear from the preferred area (INPFC 1963) was removed and mounted on a standard microscope slide for aging. Smolt weight was recorded to the nearest 0.1 g using a digital balance and tip-of-snout to fork-of-tail length (TL) was recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm. After sampling, all smolt were revived and released downstream of each trap site. Scale aging was conducted using a microfiche reader equipped with a 42x lens. All ages were recorded in European notation (KOO 1962).</para>
 <para>Trap efficiency was estimated at least weekly dependent upon smolt availability. The procedure (referred to as a dye test) involved releasing up to 500 dyed smolt about 1 km upstream of the trap location in a low velocity water flow area (&lt;0.5 m/sec). The dye tests were scheduled so that the release time was approximately 2200 hrs. Smolts used for dye tests were collected from the trap within three days and often within one day of each test. An instream covered flow through live box with perforated sides was used to hold the smolts prior to upstream transport. Transport was performed using backpacks and 19 L plastic buckets equipped with battery-powered aerators. At the release sites, smolts were placed into instream live boxes and held for about 30 minutes before transfer into a continuously-oxygenated dye solution of 1.9 g Bismarck Brown Y dye to 57 L of water for another 30 minutes. After dyeing, the smolt were held for about 60 minutes in an instream perforated live box with lid, and then placed in water filled 19 L buckets for release across the stream channel. At each step in the process, the smolt were counted, and those that behaved abnormally were destroyed. Following the release of dyed fish, the liveboxes were checked for three or more days for recoveries. All recaptures were recorded separately from the unmarked fish catch and were not included in the daily trap or weir catch totals.</para>
 <para>Experiments conducted at both Red and Akalura Lakes demonstrated a significant difference in mortality rates between dyed and un-dyed smolt (Swanton et al. 1996; Swanton et al in review). In order to adjust for this potential bias in mark-recapture estimates of the smolt outmigration, delayed mortality of dyed fish was estimated concurrent with each dye test (Carlson et al. In review; Thedinga et al. 1994). To accomplish this, an additional 100 smolt were dyed along with the smolt to be released. Smolt used for the mortality experiment were handled identically to those released, except never released. The smolt were held in a covered instream flow through live box and checked daily for 5 days; mortalities were recorded and removed from the live box.</para>
