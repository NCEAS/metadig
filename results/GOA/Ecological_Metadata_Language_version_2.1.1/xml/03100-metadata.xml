<abstract><para>Abstract: Chinook salmon incubated and reared at Wally Noerenberg Hatchery were released in Crab Bay, adjacent to the native community of Chenega. Adult salmon returning to the site of release will provide replacement resources and associated services injured by the Exxon Valdez  oil spill. Three releases have taken place (1994, 1995, 1996) as part of this multi-year project. Adult salmon will begin returning in 1996 and 1997, with larger numbers projected at nearly 1,000 adult fish, returning in 1998 and thereafter.

Studv History: 50,000 chinook salmon smolt were released in the summers of 1994, 1995 and 1996 at Crab Bay on Evans Island, Prince William Sound as part of an ongoing Trustee Council program to replace injured subsistence resources and services (Restoration Projects 94272,95272 and 96272). Chinook salmon return varying between adult ages of 4 and 7 years. A few adults are anticipated to begin returning in 1996, with nearly 1,000 returning in 1998 as the age classes build and releases continue. Chinook salmon returning to Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corporation's Wally Noerenberg Hatchery (WNH) at Esther Island were harvested as brood stock. Eggs were taken and incubated at the hatchery and the resultant fry reared for an additional year to smolt size. 50,000 smolt were released at Crab Bay. This annual cycle will continue through 1998.

 <para>Annually, 95,000 chinook salmon eggs are taken at PWSAC's Wally Noerenberg Hatchery (W) on Esther Island. Brood stock are harvested from among adult chinook salmon returning to the hatchery. Following incubation, hatch and outmigration from incubator trays, chinook fiy are reared in raceways at WNH for one year. Prior to release, chinook smolt are transferred to saltwater net pens at the hatchery or to remote release sites for a short period of saltwater rearing.</para>
 <para>In May of 1996, 50,000 chinook smolt were taken from WNH and transported via barge and fry/smolt transport tanker to Crab Bay. The smolt were released into a 350 m3 (40 ft X 40 ft X 5 ft) net pen anchored in Crab Bay and reared for two weeks at the site for imprinting and additional growth prior to release. Technical support for the incubation, hatching and feeding of the smolt were provided by PWSAC. Residents of Chenega village were trained in basic fish culture techmques, contracted to feed and rear the smolt, and paid for their services.</para>

 <para>Annually between July and August approximately 820,000 chinook salmon eggs are taken at WHN. Broodstock are harvested as adult chinook salmon returning to the facility. Adult fish are loosely confined within marine waters adjacent to the hatchery. As maturity approaches the fish volitionally move into the fresh water broodstock pond. When indicated by sampling for gamete development, eggs are taken by hatchery staff and fertilized on a 1:1 female to male ratio. The eggs are placed in the incubation facility in NOPAD incubators at a density of 84,000 eggs per tray.</para>
 <para>Following initial stages of development, chinook alevins move into incubator substrate and remain there until they emerge as fry. Fry outmigrate volitionally from the incubators and enter raceways where they are held for one year when they will have reached the smolt stage of development.</para>
 <para>A component of the 50,000 smolts for the Chenega release were marked by adipose fin removal followed by CWT. Marking and tagging aids later marine survival and harvest pattern analysis when the fish return as adults. The chinook smolts were then prepared for transfer to Crab Bay by allowing their gastro-intestinal tract to empty, loaded directly into fresh water, oxygenated transfer tanks, and barged to the Crab Bay site for rearing, imprinting and release. At no time prior to being released at Crab Bay were the fish subjected to salt water which could affect their imprinting. At Crab Bay the fish were gravity flushed into an anchored net pen 12 m x 12 x 1.5 m deep (220 m^3) for locational imprinting. Under contract, residents of Chenega were trained to monitor and feed the young fish during the imprinting and rearing phase.</para>
 <para>Smolts were released from net pens by disconnecting the nets from their float attachments allowing the fish to swim freely into marine environs.</para>
