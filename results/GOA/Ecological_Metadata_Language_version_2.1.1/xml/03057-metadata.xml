<abstract><para>In 2001, Short et al. (2004) identified residual oil from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in intertidal sediments. In the current study, five pairs of intertidal stations, each composed of one oiled and one nearby unoiled station (as identified by concurrent National Marine Fisheries Service studies), were evaluated for potential ecological impacts due to subsurface lingering oil. Oiled sediments were not toxic in the larval mussel bioassay using Mytilusedulis galloprovincialis, where development and survival in the 100% elutriate were equivalent to the unoiled stations and the controls. Significant toxicity was observed in the 28-day amphipod bioassay using Leptocheirus plumulosus, where survival at the oiled stations was 0% while survival in the unoiled stations ranged from 37 to 84%. Survival was inversely related to sediment PAH and positively related to percent fines (p&lt;0.05). However, decreased survival in the unoiled sediments suggests that this test may have been influenced by the predominance of very coarse sediments and a lack of fine-grained sediments. Benthic community structure was found to be similar between most oiled and unoiled stations; however, the power of statistical tests was low due to replicate variability. Study results indicate that residual oil sequestered in intertidal sediments is not causing community-wide effects though populations of sensitive species, such as amphipods, may be impaired.

<methods><methodStep><description><section><title>Experimental Design</title>
<para>The most significant challenge in developing this study design was the selection of meaningful indicators of the condition of the benthic community. Benthic infauna sampling was conducted to obtain direct measurement of the condition of benthic communities, and sampling was replicated to address the issue of natural variability. Chronic sediment toxicity tests, which evaluate sublethal endpoints such as development, growth, and reproduction, were also conducted. More than one chronic test was conducted to more fully characterize the potential effects of oil on sensitive life stages of species that represent different phyla. Potential tests were limited to those with established methodologies. The larval mussel test using Mytilus edulis galloprovincialis (formerly known as Mytilus edulis) was chosen because it is a relatively sensitive developmental test using a molluscan species that is representative of species present in Prince William Sound, including the clams that serve as the primary food source for sea otters. Leptocheirus plumulosus was chosen forthe 28-day amphipod survival and growth test because it is the most tolerant amphipod test species for coarse grained sediments (USEPA 2001). Species from these two phyla are also prey items for sea otters (clams) and seabirds (mussels and amphipods).</para>
<para>Potential effects of lingering oil were assessed by evaluating differences in sediment chemistry, toxicity, and benthic community structure between oiled and unoiled station pairs. Five pairs of stations were identified, located in North Herring Bay, Herring Bay, Bay of Isles, Northwest Bay, and Disk Island. These stations were already being assessed for oil bioavailability by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). One station within each pair had been historically classified as heavily oiled while the other station, located nearby and containing similar geomorphology and wave exposure, lacked oil based on the 2001 sampling by Short et al. (2004). Stations classified historically as heavily oiled were purposefully selected to provide data to assess potential ecological effects under worst-case conditions. Station elevation was consistent among all stations (3-meter vertical drop from mean higher high water) to eliminate variability associated with intertidal zonation.</para>
<para>The sampling program focused on surface sediments (0-10 cm) because these are the sediments that typically contain the highest abundances of infauna, and the study objective was to evaluate potential impacts to intertidal benthic communities. When Short et al. (2004) investigated beaches forlingering oil, they dug pits as deep as 1-2 feet and found oil at varying depths below the sediment surface. The results of the research reported here are applicable to surface conditions above buried lingering oil but cannot be used to directly infer the concentrations or toxicity of the residual oil that is located at depth.</para>
<para>Concurrent sampling efforts were performed for the toxicity testing and benthic community evaluation. Sediments for toxicity testing were collected to a depth of 10 cm, which generally included sediments where oil was visibly present. At each of the five station pairs, sediments were collected with a 4 in. diameter core and analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), PAHs, total organic carbon (TOC), total solids, grain-size distribution, and toxicity using the larval mussel bioassay and the 28-day amphipod survival and growth bioassay. Elutriate samples were prepared forthe larval mussel bioassay and were also analyzed for PAHs.</para>
<para>Ten replicate 4 in. diameter cores were collected to a depth of approximately 10 cm to assess the structure of the benthic community, and eight of the ten replicate samples were processed by a taxonomic laboratory. Immediately adjacent to each of the benthic cores, additional sediment was collected to a depth of about 2 cm for analysis of grain size, TOC, and TPH. These physical and chemical analyses were conducted on the top 2-cm interval because in many habitats a majority of benthic invertebrates are found in the upper few centimeters of surface sediment. The resulting data may provide a more meaningful evaluation of the potential exposure of benthic organisms to oil than data generated over a deeper sediment layer.</para>

<methodStep><description><section><title>Field Methods</title>
<para>All field sampling methods followed Puget Sound Estuary Program protocols (PSEP 1987). Samples were collected during low tide and transported to the sampling vessel for processing. Sediment for synoptic chemical and toxicity testing was collected using 4 in. diameter, decontaminated, stainless-steel hand corers and placed into stainless-steel pots. Equipment was decontaminated between stations. During processing, the sediment was thoroughly homogenized until it was uniform in color and texture and then distributed to sample jars. Sediment for grain-size analysis and toxicity testing was refrigerated at approximately 4C, while the remaining sediment samples were frozen at approximately -20C.</para>
<para>Benthic samples were also collected using 4 in. diameter cores. Upon removal of each corer from the sediment the contents of the core were placed into a labeled zip-locked bag and returned to the vesselfor processing. During processing, the contents of each core were sieved using a gentle stream of site water through nested 2.5 mm and 1.0 mm benthic sieves. All organisms retained on the 2.5 mm sieve and all material retained on the 1.0 mm sieve were bagged, preserved with a solution of 10% buffered formalin, and stored in sealed buckets prior to shipment to the taxonomic laboratory.</para>
<para>One deviation from the experimental design occurred. Benthic samples could not be collected from North Herring Bay due to a cobble and boulder overburden that, when removed, clearly affected the population of gammaridae amphipods in surface sediments.</para>

<para>Sediment and elutriate samples were analyzed for PAHs by the NMFS Auke Bay Laboratory (Juneau, Alaska) using their standard methodologies for samples associated with the spill (Short et al. 1996). Analytical Resources, Inc. (Seattle, Washington) analyzed both the composite and individual benthic surface sediments for TPH by EPA methods 3510, 3540/3550, and 8000, and total solids and grain size by PSEP (1986) methods. Composite samples were also analyzed for TOC by EPA method 9060.</para>

<methodStep><description><section><title>Lab Methods: Sediment Toxicity Bioassays</title>
<para>Bioassay testing was performed by MEC-Weston, Inc. (Tiburon, California). The potential toxicity of substances associated with pore water was evaluated using the 48-hour larval test with the mussel Mytilus edulis gallioprovincialis. Tests were conducted following methods provided in the "Inland Testing Manual" (USEPA/USACE 1998), USEPA (1995), and MEC-Weston Protocol MEC-BIO-043. A modified elutriate was prepared by mixing sediment with seawater and then removing particles &gt;0.45 um in diameter by settling. The initial dilution ratio of sediment to seawatertargeted approximately 4.125% pore waterin the final elutriate because this was the approximate average percent water content of the samples. The fraction water content of each sediment treatment (g porewater/g sediment) was determined by weighing an aliquot of sediment, drying at 80C for 24 hours, and then reweighing. The resulting difference was then used to determine the percentage of pore water in the sediment samples.</para>
<para>The amount of sediment required to produce porewater(PW) concentrations of 41.25 mL pore water/L of elutriate was determined using the following formula: grams of sediment/L seawater = (41.25 g PW/L seawater)/(g PW/g sediment)</para>
<para>The sediment/seawater mixture was combined in a 1-gallon glass jar and stirred vigorously by a mechanical tumbling device for 30 minutes. The mixture was then allowed to settle for 1 hour. The supernatant was carefully siphoned off, without disturbing the settled material, and immediately used for testing. The elutriate siphoned from the settled material represented 100% of the suspended-particulate porewater test material. Concentrations of 1%, 10%, 50%, and 100% elutriate were made from this material and dilution water prepared from artificial sea salts (bioassay grade Crystal Sea Marine Mix),resulting in porewater concentrations of 4.125%, 2.0625%, 0.4125%, and 0.04125% pore water. Seawater was used for the negative control.</para>
<para>Sediment toxicity was also evaluated using the 28-day amphipod test using Leptocheirus plumulosus following methods in USEPA (2001) and MEC-Weston Protocol MEC-BIO-077. The 28-day Leptocheirustest is a static-renewal bedded sediment test that evaluates both survival and growth of neonate amphipods. Test organisms were reared in the laboratory in native sediments. Native sediment was also used for control sediment treatments.</para>
