        <othercit>A detailed report on how this data set was created is available to download from the program's web site. The report discusses methods and results, and includes descriptions and dichotomous keys to vegetation types, map classification and descriptions, and accuracy assessment (AA) contingency tables. It also provides information on the aerial photographs and how they were interpreted. Detailed background information for each map class and attribute code contained in this data set is provided in the project report.</othercit>

      <abstract>The vegetation point data for Grand Portage National Monument (GRPO) was developed to support two projects associated with the 2006 vegetation map, the collection of detailed vegetation plot data, and the vegetation map's accuracy assessment project. The vegetation plot project was conducted to develop the map classification scheme. A total of 23 vegetation plot sites were sampled at GRPO. A detailed vegetation analysis of these data along with information collected from previous classification projects were used to develop the map classification scheme, in accordance with the National Vegetation Classification System. The accuracy assessment project was conducted to locate and document potential thematic errors (i.e., the assignment of an incorrect map class), specifically user's accuracy (suitability for a particular application) and producer's accuracy (conformance to production standards). The AA was performed only on map classes representing NVCS natural/semi-natural vegetation types. The GRPO vegetation map was determined to have an overall AA of 91.8% (Kappa index of 90.7%). A total of 147 sites were observed for the accuracy assessment project. More detailed results are presented in the GRPO project report via a contingency table available on the program's website. The GIS data set contains point data features, projected to Universal Transverse Mercator zone 16 mapping coordinates, North American Datum 1983.</abstract>
      <purpose>The NPS Vegetation Inventory Program (VIP) is an effort to classify, describe, and map existing vegetation of national park units. Managed by the NPS Biological Resources Management Division, the NPS VIP provides baseline vegetation information for the NPS Natural Resource I&amp;M Program. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Vegetation Characterization Program lends a cooperative role in the NPS VIP. Vegetation layers and associated information support a wide variety of resource assessment, park management, and planning needs. They also provide structure for framing and answering critical scientific questions about vegetation communities and their relation to environmental processes across the landscape.</purpose>

        <procdesc>Vegetation Plots:  Field sampling methodology was adapted from the NPS Vegetation Inventory Program standards (NatureServe 2004).   Field crews sampled 22 plots during latew-summers of 2008 and one plot in 2009.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Vegetation Plots:  All field data were entered into PLOTS2, an MS Access database designed for this vegetation mapping program (NatureServe 2005b).  These plots were analyzed using ordination (non-metric multidimensional scaling or NMS) and clustering techniques (Flexible Beta) with PC-Ord 5.0 (McCune and Mefford 1999).  Data were then converted to a point shapefile in ArcGIS 9.2.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Accuracy Assessment:  Field crews were provided with listings of GPS coordinates of their (AA sites along with field maps. During the summer of 2009, field crews navigated to their sampling sites, then established AA observation plots within the minimum mapping unit (MMU) area. A number of physical characteristics were recorded for each site (e.g., location, slope, aspect, elevation) along with land cover information (e.g., dominant and subdominant vegetation, percent cover). Detailed descriptions on how these plots were established and sampled are available in the GRPO vegetation mapping project report, available online.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Accuracy Assessment:  The field data were then automated, and brought into the software programs ArcView GIS version 3.3 and ArcGIS version 9.2. Information collected in the field was compared to those developed by the photo interpreters (digital data and photo overlays). Results were used to determine; spatial GPS coordinate errors, map automation errors, Unclassified vegetation type on field data sheet errors, incomplete crosswalk between map classes and vegetation type errors, questionable field calls, and inclusion errors (areas missed as they were below the minimum mapping unit). Results of this analysis are available in the GRPO mapping project report, available on the program's web site.</procdesc>
