      <abstract>High resolution vegetation polygons mapped by the National Park Service. Vegetation at Lake Meredith National Recreation Area/Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument and environs was mapped and classified by a combination of field plot data collected in 2004 and photointerpreted from 1:12000 scale infrared aerial photography acquired in 2002. The protocols and standards used are those described in the National Vegetation Program documents.</abstract>
      <purpose>Vegetation maps of National Parks and National Monuments were developed to support natural resources management, planning, research and interpretation.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Data were imported to a file geodatabase by the Colorado Natural Heritage Program/Colorado State University. Parks had the flexibility to map vegetation down to the map class or to the association. Refer to lamr-alflrpt.pdf for more detailed information.</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>This project received an accuracy assessment during the field season of 2005.  283 accuracy assessment points were recorded.  The results were the subject of a fuzzy accuracy assessment.  Fuzzy accuracies are reported for overall map accuracy and individual map unit accuracy.  Overall map accuracy for fuzzy classes five, four and three are 62.9%, 72.4% and 85.5%.  See the Vegetation Report for information about individual map unit accuracies and more specifics with regard to methods.</attraccr>

        <procdesc>The 1:12000 scale infrared aerial photography and the digital orthophoto basemap used in this project were acquired/created in 2002. The plot data collection occured in 2004 and the accuracy assessment was conducted in 2005.  As such, the vegetation map represents ground conditions at the time of aerial photography acquisition in 2002.

Photointerpretation:  All map classes were interpreted from the 1:12000 scale color infrared photography.  Photo-interpretation used the standard identification features such as tone, texture, color, pattern, topographic position and shadow.  The line work was transferred into the GIS database by heads-up digitizing.  Heads-up digitizing is a procedure whereby the operator digitizes by hand and eye on a computer terminal screen showing a digital image of an ortho-rectified photo.  By looking at similar features on both the aerial photograph and on the orthophoto, the line drawn on the aerial photo overlay is manually transferred to the digital image.  The 9" X 9" aerial photographs are viewed in stereo as part of this process to ensure placement of the vegetation polygons.</procdesc>
