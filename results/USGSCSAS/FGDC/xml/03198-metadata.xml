<abstract>High resolution vegetation polygons mapped by the National Park Service. The National Park Service (NPS), in conjunction with the Biological Resources Division (BRD) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has implemented a program to develop a uniform hierarchical vegetation mapping methodology and classification at a national level and apply it to National Parks. The purpose of the data is to document the state of vegetation on Mt. Wanda at the John Muir National Historic Site during 2004, thereby providing a snapshot of conditions to assist in future monitoring and management. The vegetation units of this map were determined through visual interpretation of aerial photographs supported by field sampling. The vegetation boundaries were identified on the photographs by means of the photographic signatures and collateral information on slope, topography, and vegetation as outlined by the California Native Plant Society. The mapped vegetation reflects conditions present on Mt. Wanda during the months of May through July of 2004. Several sets of aerial photography were utilized for this project: 1.) color aerial photograph of Contra Costa County, March 2003, 1:24,000 provided by Contra Costa County 2.) black and white aerial photograph taken in May of 2000 at 1:20,000. There is an inherent margin of error in the use of aerial photography for vegetation delineation and classification.</abstract>
<purpose>Vegetation maps of National Parks and National Monuments were developed to support natural resources management, planning, research and interpretation.</purpose>
<supplinf>Data were imported to a file geodatabase by the Colorado Natural Heritage Program/Colorado State University. Parks had the flexibility to map vegetation down to the map class or to the association. Refer to jomurpt.pdf for more detailed information. The shapefile was imported into a geodatabase by the USGS/CSS/Core Science Analytics and Synthesis.</supplinf>
