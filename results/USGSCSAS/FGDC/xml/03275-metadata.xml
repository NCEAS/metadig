    <descript>
      <abstract>Vegetation field plots at Jewel Cave NM were visited, described, and documented in a digital database. The database consists of 2 parts - (1) Physical Descriptive Data, and (2) Species Listing.

The accuracy assessment field work was performed in July and August, 1996 to verify the accuracy of the vegetation communities spatial data developed by the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program for Jewel Cave National Monument.  The data points were randomly distributed stratified according to vegetation association over the project area according to protocols developed by the Program. Points were located by GPS navigation and the community information was collected at the point, without knowledge of the attributes of the vegetation spatial data. The data points were compared to the attributes of the polygon in which they were contained.  Attributes of the polygons or accuracy assessment points that did not match were changed during later analysis due to errors in the AA methodology or map attribution errors.  A contingency table was completed from the final dataset.</abstract>
      <purpose>Provide National Parks with the necessary tools to effectively manage their natural resources. Plot data is collected and analyzed to develop a classification (using the Standardized National Vegetation Classification System) and description of vegetation types in preparation for photointerpretation and mapping of the monument's vegetation types. The AA data were necessary assess the mapping effort in addition to meeting the requirements of the mapping program.</purpose>
      <supplinf>All codes used in the digital file are referenced by the look-up table that accompanies this file. The look-up table is called veg.lut. It contains both the common name and latin names of the vegetation types. Data were reformatted to match Plots V3.0 by the USGS/CSS/Core Science Analytics and Synthesis.</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Descriptive plot data were collected for 29 sites whose vegetation represents a full spectrum of alliance types present within Jewel Cave National Monument and its immediate surroundings. Physical description - Attributes collected for each site include: a unique plot identification code, park name, quad name, UTM coordinates, UTM projection, plot survey date, surveyor's name, length, width, photo type, elevation, slope aspect, topographic position, landform, surface geology, Cowardin System category, hydrology, surface material description, soil texture, soil drainage, leaf phenology, leaf type, and physiognomy. Species - Individual species described at each 29 plots is listed, one line per species, with the information: Plot Identification code, Species Name, Species Cover (0=trace, 1=&lt; 1%, 2=1-5%, 3=5-25%, 4=25-50%, 5=50-75%, 6=75-100%), and Plant Strata (T, S, H. v.s, and no entry).

The attributes for the accuracy assessment were recorded in the field in July and August, 1996. Vegetation associations were identified based on the field key and plant identification.  If additional communities were found within a 50 meter radius of the plot center, they were recorded as well. During the analysis, it was concluded that some attributes were in error and changed to match the mapped attributes. This was done by examination of the aerial photographs under stereoscopic view. The attributes were in error due to 1) spatial error in the GPS derived coordinates (4-8 meters), 2) change of vegetation community due to temporal changes, or mis-identification of the community on the ground.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>Entries for each of the listed attributes are in the form of consistent groupings of either textual or numerical descriptors. All attributes are codes that correspond to vegetation communities and have been checked for typographical and logical errors.</logic>
    <complete>Descriptive entries for each of the 29 plots are complete for each of the applicable attributes listed in the database. All AA points were collected and analyzed.</complete>

        <methdesc>Field sampling using releve plots. To assess the thematic accuracy of the vegetation map we conducted an accuracy assessment that allows the user of the digital information an additional perspective upon the data. The final product attempts to achieve the 80% per class accuracy required for this product. Not all mapping units were tested for accuracy. Since the final map contains two separate classification systems, only the mapped areas that fall under the NVCS were included in the accuracy assessment. Areas such as agricultural and undescribed vegetation units and other areas classified using Anderson Level II classification were eliminated from the sample process. Besides excluding the Anderson classified polygons we also excluded vegetation polygons visited and sampled during either the vegetation description or verification phase that were small enough to confidently say were entirely correct. These were typically riparian polygons in Hell Canyon. These small polygons were eliminated from a site visit in the random selection process but were included in the final accuracy assessment matrix. The remaining areas for sampling were then stratified and sampled according to the number of polygons in each class and the area occupied by each class. Field Procedure: The field crew consisted of two botanists that were not involved in any part of the previous work on the park. This crew either worked together or separately depending upon local conditions. Both botanists were supplied with a list of points to visit, a field key for map class identification, field data forms, and a GPS to navigate to each site forms . Both crew members worked "blind', meaning that neither one was aware of the existing mapped class designations. Upon arriving at each site, the crews scanned a wide area around the immediate location and observed any local variation in the plant associations. Using the key,the crew then assigned a plant association to the accuracy point. In cases where the variation was significant the crew made a "best fit" judgment to the class name. In addition, other associations in the area and those that might be confused with other plant associations were also noted on each field form. Site Selection: The stratified random selection of accuracy assessment sites was done on the original map classes. The x and y coordinates of each accuracy point were derived from the original vegetation coverage. The coverage was gridded into 50 x 50 meter cells using ArcGrid. A 50-meter grid was chosen because it approximates the minimum mapping unit (MMU) for the project. Using a random number generator, we then re-selected the appropriate number of grids/samples from each class and put them into a separate grid. Additional points were selected for each class over the required number to allow the field crew some latitude in case some sites were inaccessible. The reselected cells where then converted into a point coverage. The x and y coordinate for each point was then transferred to an ascii file. This coordinate file was then used by the field team along with a GPS PLGR unit to locate the position in the field. The point coverage with the accuracy locations and the assigned map unit code are included as a digital coverage. Data Analysis: Due to the inherent heterogeneity of many natural systems, many of the map class determinations to be incorrect. However, when considered in the larger context were correct. To address this issue we attempted to include a 'fuzzy' protocol in analyzing the field accuracy data. For example, when the field crew visited a site they noted not only the appropriate vegetation association designation for the immediate area but also other associations present. When field codes where then compared with the mapped class the point was designated correct if it agreed with any of the associations noted on the field form.</methdesc>

        <procdesc>The following describes the tasks performed by The Nature Conservancy to produce descriptive data for 29 vegetation sampling plots in two separate database files. Physical description - The first of the two contains general descriptive information at each of the plots. Plot sites were selected by information obtained during a reconnaissance visit to the park in April of 1995, and by examining tone and textural patterns on the JECA AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS. Site physical parameters, species types, and vegetation strata were described at each site. The PLOT DATA database contains tabulations of site physical factors, listed under the ATTRIBUTE ACCURACY REPORT for each of the 29 plots. Plot data were manually recorded on field forms on-site, and subsequently keyed into the database files described herein. Information in the plot database was then used to develop the classification system and plant identification keys contained in the TNC JECA SAMPLING AND CLASSIFICATION REPORT. Species - The second contains listings of individual species found in each plot, along with cover estimates and height (strata) delineations. The SPECIES LISTING database contains line entries for each species including the Plot Code, and Plant Strata delineation. See 2.1.1 (Accuracy assessment Report) for explanations of these attributes. Plot data were manually recorded on field forms on-site, and subsequently keyed into the database files described herein. Information in the plot database was then used to develop the classification system and plant indentification keys contained in the TNC JECA SAMPLING AND CLASSIFICATION.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The accuracy assessment field work was performed in July, 1996 to verify the accuracy of the vegetation communities spatial data developed by the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program for Jewel Cave National Monument.  The data points were randomly distributed stratified according to vegetation association over the project area according to protocols developed by the Program. Points were located by GPS navigation and the community information was collected at the point, without knowledge of the attributes of the vegetation spatial data.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>Each of 29 vegetation mapping plot sites contains the attributes of species found. Physical description - General plot information is described by identification codes, locational information (including state, park name, and USGS 7 1/2' topographic quad name). Physical factors tabulated in the database include UTM_X, UTM_Y, UTM Zone, map projection, survey date, name of surveyors, plot length and width, type of photos used, plot elevation, slope aspect, topographic position, landform type, surface geology, Cowardin system descriptor, hydrology, rock size, surface material type, soil texture and drainage, leaf phenology, leaf type, and physiognomy. Species - (sp_code is a project specific code for each species found, species is the scientific name for that species, spcover is the species present and the percent cover for each species, plant code is the first two letters of the genus and first two letters of the species. If the code are not unique a number is added to make the code unique). This includes strata cover which is an average percent cover of that particular species, 1 = 0-10%, 2= 10-25%, 3 = 25-60% and 4 = 60-100%, pstrata is the type of vegetation, T1 = emergent, T2 = canopy, T3 = sub-canopy, S1 = tall shrub, S2 = short shrub, H = herbaceous, N = non-vascular, V = vine/liana, and E = epiphyte.

The system is organized hierarchically to support conservation and resource stewardship applications across multiple scales. The upper levels of the hierarchy are based on the physical form or structure of the vegetation (physiognomy) and have been refined from the international standards developed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).  The two most detailed levels of the hierearchy are based on the species composition of the existing vegetation (floristics) and reflect the phyto-sociological standards that were originally developed by European ecologists. The vegetation classification is continually advanced through the collection and analysis of new field data and will be greatly strengthened during the course of the NBS/NPS mapping efforts.
