<abstract>
The vegetation point data layer for the Saint Croix National Scenic Riverway  (SACN) vegetation mapping project was developed to show locations and provide field data from two efforts associated with the vegetation mapping project, of which both support the vegetation spatial polygon layer (vegetation map) produced of SACN (based from interpreting aerial imagery that was collected in October 2005). These two efforts include 1) vegetation plot sampling data and 2) accuracy assessment (AA) site data.
Vegetation plot sampling was conducted to describe vegetation types and to develop the map classification scheme. A total of 230 vegetation plots were sampled in and around the SACN. A detailed vegetation analysis of these data along with information collected from previous classification projects were used to develop the map classification scheme, in accordance with the National Vegetation Classification Standard (NVCS) Version 2.
Quick plots were also collected during the 2006 field season for vegetation plot sampling. These additional quick plots were used as an ancillary data set to better understand the vegetation of the SACN. A total of 63 quick plots are included in this database, of which 59 were collected during the 2006 vegetation plot sampling season. An additional 4 plots were added to the quick plot dataset later on to preserve data from some AA sites that had received duplicate site numbers.
The AA site sampling was conducted to measure the probability that a particular location has been assigned its correct vegetation class in the vegetation map layer. An AA estimates thematic errors in the data, giving users information needed to determine data suitability for a particular application. Two views of an AA are provided: 1) "producers' accuracy," which is the probability that an AA point has been mapped correctly (also referred to as an error of omission), and 2) "users' accuracy," which is the probability that the map actually represents what was found on the ground (also referred to as error of commission). The AA was performed on map classes representing floristic-level vegetation types in the NVCS (and one map class representing a group-level type in the NVCS). A total of 1,291 AA observation sites were collected, and 1,257 were used in the analysis. From the thematic AA study, results present an overall accuracy of 77.2% (kappa index of 76.4%). Most individual map-class themes exceed the NPS VIP standard of 80% with a 90% confidence interval. Results are shown via a contingency table.
The project report for the SACN vegetation mapping project provides details pertaining to the methods of the vegetation plot sampling and accuracy assessment studies, as well as results from the analyses of each study. The vegetation database used to populate the feature classes and relationship classes of the vegetation point data locations is available on the program's websites. The GIS data set contains point data features, projected to Universal Transverse Mercator zone 15 mapping coordinates, North American Datum 1983.

<purpose>The NPS VIP is an effort to classify, describe, and map existing vegetation of national park units. Managed by the NPS Biological Resources Management Division, the NPS VIP provides baseline vegetation information for the NPS Natural Resource I&amp;M Program. The USGS Vegetation Characterization Program lends a cooperative role in the NPS VIP and serves the data sets on the Internet. Vegetation layers and associated information support a wide variety of resource assessment, park management, and planning needs. They also provide structure for framing and answering critical scientific questions about vegetation communities and their relation to environmental processes across the landscape.</purpose>

<procdesc>Vegetation Plots / Quick Plots: Field sampling methodology was adapted from the NPS Vegetation Inventory Program standards (NatureServe 2004). Field crews sampled 230 vegetation plots during the summers of 2006 and 2007. Another 59 quick plots were collected during 2006, and an additional 4 plots were added to the quick plot database after the AA analysis as a placeholder of some AA sites that had been numbered incorrectly, resulting in duplicate site numbers but different sites.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Vegetation Plots / Quick Plots: Field data collected during the 2006 and 2007 field seasons were entered into PLOTS2, an MS Access database designed for this vegetation mapping program (NatureServe 2005b). The vegetation plots were analyzed using ordination (non-metric multidimensional scaling or NMS) and clustering techniques (Flexible Beta) with PC-Ord 5.0 (McCune and Mefford 1999). The quick plots were used as an ancillary data set to better understand the vegetation of the SACN. Point shapefile sets were produced in ArcGIS 9.3 of both the vegetation plots and the quick plots. Results of the vegetation plot analyses are in the project report, available on the program's websites.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Accuracy Assessment: Field crews were provided with listings of GPS coordinates of AA sites along with field maps. During the summer of 2009 and 2010, field crews navigated to their sampling sites, then established AA observation plots within the minimum mapping unit (MMU) area. A number of physical characteristics were recorded for each site (e.g., location, slope, aspect, elevation) along with land cover information (e.g., dominant and subdominant vegetation, percent cover). Detailed descriptions on how these plots were established and sampled are available in the report for the vegetation mapping project, available online. A total of 1,291 AA sites were collected.</procdesc>

Results of this analysis, including a contingency table showing thematic errors of omission and commission, are available in the project for the vegetation mapping project and is available on the program's websites.</procdesc>

<enttypl>sacn_vegpt</enttypl>
<enttypd>The sacn_vegpt attribute table contains attribute information directly associated with the feature class data set. If this data set were to be exported out of the file geodatabase and saved as a shapefile, the information contained within fcl_sacn_vegpt are the only attributes which would carry through to the new shapefile. The other attributes within the various lookup tables (e.g., tbl_vegpt_vp_clsf, tbl_vegpt_vp_location, etc.) contain additional information and are associated to the feature class data set within the geodatabase through a series of geodatabase relationship classes (e.g., vegpt_vp_clsf,  vegpt_vp_location, etc.). For these tables to export along with the feature class into a shapefile, they would first need to be joined to the feature class data set prior to exporting.</enttypd>
