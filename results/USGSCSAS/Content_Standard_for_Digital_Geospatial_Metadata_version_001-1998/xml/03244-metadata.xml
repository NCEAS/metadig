        <procdesc>For each provisional vegetation type that represents actual or potential National Vegetation Classification (NVC) associations in the Natural and Seminatural Subgroups, classification plot data was collected in accordance with VMP training and protocols at CHIC.

Plot dimensions were made in accord with the following sizes.  Minimum plot sizes were those specified by The Nature Conservancy and Environmental Systems Research Institute. Forests and Woodlands were sampled with 400 square meter plots. Shrublands, Herbaceous Vegetation, and SparseVegetation were sampled with 100 square meter plots.

The total number of 100 plots was projected for the park based on its size.  Due to the extensive area covered by the lake, especially previous mesic bottomland sites, the actual area of vegetation was less, as was the diversity of habitats.  Therefore, field observation clarified the need for somewhat fewer plots as the project progressed during the field season.  Based on the vegetation classes accepted by NatureServe as potentially occurring in CHIC, a provisional classification of vegetation types was developed following a two-day reconnaissance.  An attempt was made to collect 5 replicate plots or each vegetation type. The aquatic classes were sampled with only two plots each because the areas were small in area and restricted in distribution, mostly to the backwater areas where the creeks emptied into the Lake of the Arbuckles.  Other vegetation types that were not sampled with more than two or three plots were also of limited distribution or were not developed at a distinct vegetation type from the surrounding vegetation (such as, Veg. Type 14 not distinct from Veg type 3).  Therefore, the total number of plots collected were 89 (48 forest/woodland plots and 41 grassland/shrubland plots).  Twenty-nine provisional vegetation types were discernable by the PI.

The primary sampling strategy for vegetation plots was to adequately represent vegetation types with a secondary focus to distribute them geographically within the park.  Thus, plots were spaced so as to be in separate presumed polygons (polygons not actually delineated on field aerials available).  An exception to this rule was made, especially for grasslands and wetlands.  In several cases, plots of the different grassland and aquatic associations were selected to be in close proximity to one another to show the patchiness of the environments and to help the mappers determine if these associations have distinct enough signatures to be identified in the aerial images.

Five additional observation points were taken for areas that were too small to be mapped or were not suited to plot techniques, such as submerged aquatic vegetation.  These observation points were collected to aid the mappers in developing signatures for these distinct but localized vegetation types. Agricultural/urban sites that fall within the Anderson classification scheme were not sampled nor given observation points.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Sample Design
Selection of AA sample points followed that described by the NBS/NPS Vegetation Mapping Program, Accuracy Assessment Procedures manual.  The design attempts to adhere to scientific principles that govern sampling and statistical analysis and also be practical.  The consideration of map accuracy typically can have two components: thematic map accuracy and positional accuracy.  The accuracy assessment that follows reflects only thematic map accuracy.  Positional accuracy is not considered.  Given that polygon boundaries are only occasionally "hard" and subject to interpretation it makes little sense to spend the effort to quantify a subjective boundary.
Sample Method
The accuracy assessment protocol takes into consideration maximum and minimum sample sizes.  Considerations include statistical as well as cost constraints and mapped class abundance and frequency.  The sample selection is a stratified random sample, stratified by map units.
Sample Site Selection
These parameters were coded into in-house software programs that allows for repeat sample selection using a variety of sample choices such as cost weighting and distance from polygon boundary.  Cost weighting is used to eliminate sample points that had extremely arduous access (distance/difficulty = cost) or were in dangerous locations. This option was not used at CHIC due to the small size and relative ease (distance) and access to points.  Being able to choose minimum distance to polygon boundaries helped to eliminate ecotonal boundaries which lead to confusion and loss of effort.  A minimum distance of 10 meters was chosen for this effort.

AA sample points were selected only for areas within the Park boundary and not the entire mapping area.  Lands outside the boundary are private lands spread out over hundreds of owners therefore, access and permsion would have been prohibitively difficult.

Field crews were provided with two sets of samples.  The primary set included the preferred target for the sample selection.  If a target was inaccessible for any reason, the crews were free to substitute from a secondary set of points.  The effect of this arbitrary reselection reduces somewhat the stratified random selection of points.  The positive effect of this is to take advantage of the cost of sending a crew to a particular location.</procdesc>
