      <abstract>High resolution vegetation polygons mapped by the National Park Service. The Vegetation Map of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks was produced over an eight year period (2000-2007) to describe and map the vascular plant associations of the two southern Sierra Nevada national parks. Over 80,000 individual vegetation polygons are mapped to 172 vegetation classes. Overall spatial accuracy of the resulting map products is equivalent to 1:24000 National Map Accuracy Standards. Vegetation delineations are based on photo interpretation of 1:15,840 scale color infrared photography acquired by Pacific Western Technologies (PWT) duirng two missions conducted in July of 2000 and 2001. Photo interpretation and automation, including rectification to the 1:24000 Digital Photo Orthoquads (DOQQs) was performed by Aerial Information Systems (AIS) under subcontract to Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), who provided project management and final cartographic products. Development of the National Vegetation Classification Standard (NVCS) compliant mapping classification and accuracy assessment of the final map products, along with all associated field sampling, was performed by NPS ecologists at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Overall map accuracy is 80% at the association level and 86% at the alliance level (based on 2409 field assessments). This version also contains CALVEG crosswalks used by the California U.S. Forest Service. Crosswalks to fuel models were added based on both USFS and NPS methods.</abstract>
      <purpose>Vegetation maps of National Parks and National Monuments were developed to support natural resources management, planning, research and interpretation.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Data were imported to a file geodatabase by the Colorado Natural Heritage Program/Colorado State University. Parks had the flexibility to map vegetation down to the map class or to the association. Note that the accuracy of an individual class will vary from the overall accuracy figures reported above, and that due to limited resources not all classes were fully evaluated using field data. Refer to the accuracy assessment section of the supporting documentation for detailed information and type specific accuracy results.</supplinf>

      <attraccr>The NPS field reconnaissance team collected accuracy assessment points in the field using GPS for comparison to the final map product to determine the user and producer accuracies on a class-by-class basis for each vegetation unit. The accuracy assessment points were reviewed and analyzed by the field reconnaissance team and photo interpretation team for each class type to discuss and determine the final accuracy designation for each class. Some classes have been combined within the hierarchy to improve the overall accuracy of the final map and although these omitted types are still listed in the final map classification they are no longer present within the final cartographic product. The omitted types are also still listed in the features as original PI codes for the map data. The following are the vegetation classification types assessed for accuracy indicating the sampling analysis including the user's and producer's accuracy. 0100 = Alpine Talus Slope (assign density) Number Correct = 6 User's Total = 6 Producer's Total = 6 User's % Correct = 100 Producer's % Correct = 100;

        <attracce>The vegetation classification system is organized hierarchically to support conservation and resource stewardship applications across multiple scales. The upper levels of the hierarchy are based on the physical form or structure of the vegetation (physiognomy) and have been refined from the international standard developed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The two most detailed levels of the hierarchy are based on the species composition of the existing vegetation (floristics) and reflect the phyto-sociological standards that were originally developed by European ecologists. The vegetation classification is continually advanced through the collection and analysis of new field data and will be greatly strengthened during the course of the USGS-NPS mapping efforts. The final USGS - NPS Vegetation Final Mapping Classification for Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks is based upon the following association and alliance level classification types as well as associated landuse and non-vegetated types: 0000 = Sparsely Vegetated/Miscellaneous Classes, 0100 = Alpine Talus Slope (assign density) 0200 = Alpine Scree Slope (assign density) 0300 = Alpine Snow Patch Communities (no density) 0400 = Alpine Fell-field (assign density) 0500 = Mesic Rock Outcrop (no density) 0700 = Boulder Field (no density) 0900 = Sparsely Vegetated/Miscellaneous Classes (continued) 0910 = Post Disturbance Conifer Reproduction (assign density) 0920 = Conifer Plantation (assign density) 0940 = Sparsely Vegetated Undifferentiated (no density) 0941 = Sparsely Vegetated Riverine Flat (no density) 0950 = Non-alpine Talus 0960 = Rock Outcrop Undifferentiated 0961 = Sparsely Vegetated to Non-vegetated Exposed Rock 0963 = Dome 0965 = Sparsely Vegetated Rocky Streambed 0970 = Alpine Permanent Snowfield/Glacier 0980 = Water 0990 = Urban/Developed (assign Land Use code) 1000 = Broadleaf Evergreen Trees 1020 = Canyon Live Oak Forest Alliance 1021 = Canyon Live Oak/Birchleaf Mountain Mahogany Forest Mapping Unit 1022 = Canyon Live Oak/Whiteleaf Manzanita Woodland Association 1023 = Canyon Live Oak-Ponderosa Pine Forest &amp;

    <logic>All polygon features are checked for topology using the ESRI ARC/INFO software. Each polygon begins and ends at the same point with the node feature. All nodes are checked for error so that there are no dangling features. There are no duplicate lines or polygons. All nodes will snap together and close polygons based on a specific tolerance. If the node is not within the tolerance, it is adjusted manually.</logic>

          <horizpae>A separate quality control step was performed for each aerial photo upon completion of the photo interpretation. A senior photo interpreter reviewed each photo for map unit delineation, PI signature code, and density code accuracy. Each photo overlay was checked for completeness, consistency, and adherence to the mapping criteria and guidelines The data automation process used to capture the vegetation linework automatically georeferenced the data into real world coordinates and each polygon was assigned an attribute. To ensure that code verification and edit plot quality assurance, an edit plot of the converted spatial data was produced for each DOQQ and compared to the aerial photo overlays. Each plot was checked for cartographic quality of the arcs defining the polygon features and the accuracy of the label assignments. Line and code changes were noted directly on the edit plot. All plots were edgematched to verify line and code accuracy across map sheets. Processors conducted interactive ARCEDIT sessions to make the necessary corrections to the coverages. During the final quality assurance of the vegetation map, the individual coverages created for each DOQQ were then joined into a single seamless vegetation coverage for the Park. This final vegetation layer was examined by a senior photo interpreter. Final checks were conducted to test for invalid codes, check for missing or extra lines, look for edgematch problems, verify the registration of linework to the DOQQ base, and to review the distribution of species mapped within the Park.</horizpae>

          <vertacce>Data automation was conducted using a semi-photogrammetric Mono Digitizing Stereo Digitizing (MDSD) software. The first step of the procedure utilized input from the USGS ortho imagery header and camera calibration report for the the creation of control points. Locational points identified both on the USGS ortho imagery and the aerial photography were identified and input into an ARC/INFO point coverage. The MDSD software used to capture the vegetation linework automatically georeferenced the data into real world coordinates. By using the control points generated in the previous step each photo was registered to the USGS ortho imagery. Once each photo was georeferenced the lines were then digitized. The digitized lines were stored in an MDSD outfile format that were then converted to a coverage using ARC/INFO. Coverage linework from each aerial photo was rectified to the project USGS ortho imagery and connected to the adjacent photo coverage. Map sheets were checked for open polygons, data registration, and any spatial edgematch problems between photos. Registration quality depended on the accuracy, quantity, and distribution of the control points. Spatial refinement was performed in ESRI ARCEDIT sessions using various user-defined tools zoomed-in at larger scales from 1:6,000 to 1:3,000. Lines depicting boundaries representing minimal ecotones (for example - land use interface, water bodies, life-form interface) were refined.</vertacce>
