      <abstract>National Park or National Monument boundary used to delineate project area. This is the designated legal boundary layer for both Sequoia National Park and Kings Canyon National Park. This theme should be used to display properties that NPS owns and properties that NPS may have some type of interest.</abstract>
      <purpose>To assist with the development of vegetation maps for the National Park Service and to describe the boundary of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. This boundary is intended for use by GIS Analysts and other general mapping purposes. It is NOT intended for use as a survey level accurate boundary.</purpose>
      <supplinf>These boundaries were originally developed by the National Park Service Land Resources Division and subsequently edited and modified by Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks GIS staff. The boundary along the North Fork of Kaweah River was digitized directly off of 2002 Digital Orthophoto Quads representing the Shadequarter Mountain Quadrangle. The remaining boundary was digitized/checked on multiple 1:24000 USGS Quadrangles. Dillonwood: On December 28, 2000, Congress passed a bill (PL 106-574) authorizing a Sequoia Park boundary modification to allow for the addition of the Dillonwood sequoia grove area located on the southern boundary of the park. The tract totals approximately 1,540 acres; However GIS analysis shows the acreage as 1518 acres. The property was purchased for $10.4 million with 5 million coming from the NPS budget and 5.4 million being privately raised through Save the Redwood Leage. On December 4, 2001, the purchase of the property was finalized. The existing access is provided by a dirt road (from the Springville area). Its poor condition may continue to limit public use of the area. The Dillonwood Boundary addition was rubbersheeted from data provided by the Assessor's Maps Bk. 144, pg. 05, County of Tulare. It should be considered only as accurate as the data provided by the Tulare County Assessor Data. Data were imported to a file geodatabase by the Colorado Natural Heritage Program/Colorado State University.</supplinf>

    <useconst>This coverage does NOT represent a surveyed boundary and should be used with caution. The newly acquired Dillonwood addition (December 4, 2001) has NOT been surveyed. Some privately owned inholdings exist within these boundaries including areas in and around Oriole Lake, Silver City, Cabin Cover, and Wilsonia. These areas do not appear within this digital data.
