        <othercit>A detailed report on how this data set was created is available to download from the program's website. The report discusses methods and results, and includes descriptions and dichotomous keys to vegetation types, map classification and descriptions, and accuracy assessment (AA) contingency tables. It also provides information on the aerial photographs and how they were interpreted. Detailed background information for each map class and attribute code contained in this data set is provided in the project report, which is available at the program's websites (website locations provided in Online_Linkage).</othercit>

      <abstract>The vegetation point data layer for the Buffalo National Scenic River (BUFF) vegetation mapping project was developed to show locations and provide field data from two efforts associated with the vegetation mapping project, of which both support the vegetation spatial polygon layer (vegetation map) produced of BUFF (based from interpreting aerial imagery that was collected in October 2006). These two efforts include 1) vegetation plot sampling data and 2) accuracy assessment (AA) site data. Vegetation plot sampling was conducted to describe vegetation types and to develop the map classification scheme. A total of 250 vegetation plots were sampled in the BUFF. A detailed vegetation analysis of these data along with information collected from previous classification projects were used to develop the map classification scheme, in accordance with the National Vegetation Classification Standard (NVCS) Version 2.  The AA site sampling was conducted to measure the probability that a particular location has been assigned its correct vegetation class in the vegetation map layer. An AA estimates thematic errors in the data, giving users information needed to determine data suitability for a particular application. Two views of an AA are provided: 1) "producers' accuracy," which is the probability that an AA point has been mapped correctly (also referred to as an error of omission), and 2) "users' accuracy," which is the probability that the map actually represents what was found on the ground (also referred to as error of commission). The AA was performed on map classes representing floristic-level vegetation types in the NVCS (and one map class representing a group-level type in the NVCS). A total of 891 AA observation sites were collected, and 889 were used in the analysis. From the thematic AA study, results present an overall accuracy of 78.9% (kappa index of 77.3%). Most individual map-class themes exceed the NPS VIP standard of 80% with a 90% confidence interval. Results are shown via a contingency table. The project report for the BUFF vegetation mapping project provides details pertaining to the methods of the vegetation plot sampling and accuracy assessment studies, as well as results from the analyses of each study. The vegetation database used to populate the feature classes and relationship classes of the vegetation point data locations is available on the program's websites. The GIS data set contains point data features, projected to Universal Transverse Mercator zone 15 mapping coordinates, North American Datum 1983.</abstract>
      <purpose>The NPS VIP is an effort to classify, describe, and map existing vegetation of national park units. Managed by the NPS Biological Resources Management Division, the NPS VIP provides baseline vegetation information for the NPS Natural Resource I&amp;M Program. The USGS Vegetation Characterization Program lends a cooperative role in the NPS VIP and serves the data sets on the Internet. Vegetation layers and associated information support a wide variety of resource assessment, park management, and planning needs. They also provide structure for framing and answering critical scientific questions about vegetation communities and their relation to environmental processes across the landscape.</purpose>
      <supplinf>There were some sites where coordinates were either not provided or there placement was outside of the BUFF &amp; we could not reconcile. There correct location. We did this to preserve the data in the actual feature class. Data were reformatted to match Plots V3.0 by the USGS/CSS/Core Science Analytics and Synthesis.</supplinf>

        <procdesc>Accuracy Assessment: Field crews were provided with listings of GPS coordinates of AA sites along with field maps. During the summer and fall of 2010, field crews navigated to their sampling sites, then established AA observation plots within the minimum mapping unit (MMU) area. A number of physical characteristics were recorded for each site (e.g., location, slope, aspect, elevation) along with land cover information (e.g., dominant and subdominant vegetation, percent cover). Detailed descriptions on how these plots were established and sampled are available in the report for the vegetation mapping project, available online. A total of 891 AA sites were collected.</procdesc>
