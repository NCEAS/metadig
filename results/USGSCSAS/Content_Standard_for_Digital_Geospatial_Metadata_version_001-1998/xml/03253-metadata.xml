      <abstract>Point features in this feature class represent locations of vegetation classification sampling plots used to develop an association-level vegetation classification and accuracy assessment points used to assess accuracy of the association-level of Cape Cod National Seashore by NatureServe for the National Park Service. Vegetation sampling was performed by NatureServe. Accuracy assesement was performed by Robert Zaremba and Lesley Sneddon.</abstract>
      <purpose>The feature class depicts point locations of vegetation classification sampling points and accuracy assessment observation points. Locations were recorded with a WAAS-enabled GPS unit. The accuracy assessment used a 76S GPS unit (WASS-enabled Garmin) was programmed with coordinates of the selected sampling locations</purpose>
      <supplinf>Data were reformatted to match Plots V3.0 by the USGS/CSS/Core Science Analytics and Synthesis.</supplinf>

    <complete>Point locations for all 127 plots and all 492 accuracy assessment points are included. Each accuracy assessment point is representaed by one point in the shapefile.  All points fall within vegetation association polygons.</complete>

        <procdesc>All vegetation plot sampling followed the USGS/NPS Vegetation Mapping Program protocols (The Nature Conservancy and Environmental Systems Research Institute 1994b).  Plots were subjectively placed to be most representative of the vegetation within a given formation polygon.

Within each polygon selected for sampling, a plot was established in an area that was most representative of the existing vegetation association (Mueller-Dombois and Ellenberg 1974).  All vegetation data were collected following NatureServe's accepted natural heritage sampling protocols (Strakosch-Walz 2000), with 20-m x 20-m plots in forests and woodlands, 10-m x 10-m plots in shrublands, and 5-m x 5-m plots in herbaceous vegetation.  In some cases, where the polygons were too narrow to reasonably accommodate standard plot sizes, the plots were adjusted accordingly, e.g., rectangular plots rather than square plots were used to accommodate linear stands.

Abbreviated instructions for completing the field form and definitions of the fields can be found in the NBS/NPS Vegetation Mapping Program: Field Methods for Vegetation Mapping manual (The Nature Conservancy and Environmental Systems Research Institute 1994b).  The vegetation was visually divided into eight strata: emergent trees (variable height), tree canopy (variable height), tree subcanopy (&gt;5m in height), tall shrub (2-5m), short shrub (&lt;2m), herbaceous, non-vascular, and vines.  The percent cover was estimated for each species in each stratum using modified Braun - Blanquet cover classes (Strakosch-Walz 2000).  Specimens of species that were not identifiable in the field were collected for later identification.  In addition to floristic information, the following environmental variables were recorded at each plot: slope, aspect, topographic position, hydrologic regime, soil stoniness, average soil texture, and soil drainage.  Any unvegetated area of the plot was characterized by the exposed substrate.  Notes were taken on the plot representativeness of the surrounding vegetation and any other significant environmental information, such as landscape context, herbivory, stand health, recent disturbance, or evidence of historic disturbance.  The vegetation profile and topographic position were sketched in cross-section to represent the location and setting of the plot.  A digital photograph of each plot was also taken.  The location of each plot was recorded with a global positioning system (GPS) unit, with the datum set to North American 1983 (Conus) and the coordinate system set to Universal Trans-Mercator (UTM) zone 19.

Plot sampling was conducted in the summer of 2003 by NatureServe. Plot forms were crosswalked to the National Vegetaiton Classification System by NatureServe's Senior Regional Ecologist, Lesley Sneddon.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Thematic accuracy has several objectives including to asssess the data's suitability for a particular application, to inform the map producers to learn more about data errors and improve the mapping process, and conform to production standards.

Accuracy assessment (AA) sampling design followed the guidelines provided in the NPS Vegetation Mapping Program (The Nature Conservancy 1994) manuals with respect to the number of AA points sampled and their distribution across park polygons. The sampling design called for  516 points during the 2004 field season. AA sampling coordinates were selected by generating random points within the minimum and maximum easting and northing UTM coordinates of the park's extent.  During July - October 2004, each accuracy assessment point was located in the field using a Garmin 76S unit. Sixteen points were eliminated prior to field work. Points were then buffered at a distance of 10 meters from the polygon border to exclude ecotonal areas that may be of ambiguous classification. Once in the field, eight points were found to be poorly accessible  or were located in areas with poor GPS reception, and were not sampled. A total of 492 accuracy assessment plots were collected. The datum on the GPS units was set to North American 1983 (Conus) and the coordinate system was set to Universal Trans-Mercator (UTM) zone 19. The vegetation association at the point was then determined using the dichotomous key and the detailed vegetation descriptions.  The minimum area of observation around the sampling point was a circle with a radius of 50 m. The dominant plant species in each stratum, environmental attributes, surrounding vegetation associations, rationale for classification and other comments were noted on a field form.  After field work was completed, data from the 492 accuracy assessment points were entered into the NatureServe PLOTS 2.0 Database System on a Microsoft Access platform.  Vegetation associations were identified using the vegetation key developed for the park. AA results were analyzed using a sample missclassification matrix. Overall accuracy, Lappa index and 90% confidence intervals were calculated in the Accuracy Assessment Procedures-USGS/NPS Vegetation Mappiong Program manual (The Nature Conservancy 1994).</procdesc>
