    <descript>
      <abstract>This data represents a vegetation map for Gauley River National Recreation Area. It contains nonoverlapping polygons which represent vegetation classes, aquatic features, and cultural features. Vegetation types were classified based on statistical analysis of plot data collected on the ground from 1995 through 2009. Polygons were delineated based on interpretation of digital and hard copy aerial photography flown in 2003. This data set was created by clipping the GARIvegetation feature class by the boundary of Gauley River National Recreation Area. Multipart polygons created by the clip operation were converted to single part polygons. Hectares and acres were calculated for each polygon using XTools.</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this data is to serve as a tool for conservation and management of natural resources in Gauley River National Recreation Area.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The shapefile was imported into a geodatabase by the USGS/CSS/BIP/Center for Biological Informatics</supplinf>

        <procdesc>Delineation of vegetation map classes was based on interpretation of digital aerial imagery utilizing additional digital and non-digital data sources. The primary imagery used as base layers for mapping were the digital orthophoto mosaics of leaf-off color infrared aerial photography flown for this project in March 2003. Additional digital aerial imagery sets which were used included leaf-off color infra-red digital orthophoto quarter quads flown in spring 1996 (USGS 1995) and true color leaf-off orthophoto quarter quads flown in spring 2003 (WVSAMB 2005). Transparencies of leaf-on color infra-red aerial photography flown for this project in October 2003 were examined on a light table to help distinguish signatures which are not apparent on leaf-off imagery. Original transparencies used to produce the leaf-off orthophoto mosaic were also examined on a light table to distinguish problematic signatures. Utilization of these multiple sets often helped to overcome deficiencies (e.g. shading) of the primary orthophoto mosaics. Ancillary GIS layers used to assist photointerpretation included digital rastor graphs of USGS topographic maps and the landform and Ecological Land Unit models developed for this project. Aerial imagery interpretation was initiated by examining signatures throughout the park in relation to GIS-mapped plot locations. Selection of map classes was driven by the imagery. When individual associations could be reliably mapped, these were chosen as map classes. Composite map classes were used when individual associations could not be distinguished due to tight zonation or patchiness. Map classes were also developed for aquatic, cultural, and disturbed areas and features. The stated minimum mapping unit for this project was 0.5 ha (1.23 ac), but smaller polygons were sometimes delineated for small patch or linear types with distinct signatures. Small creeks were mapped to the extent that their courses were visible on photography, with only short gaps estimated. Polygons were drawn using the ArcGIS editing tools with the screen set at various scales, commonly 1:3,000, depending on the vegetation patch size and distinctiveness of boundaries. Polygons were attributed with the name of the map class and, sometimes, comments related to the vegetation or its photo signature. After a relatively complete list of map classes was established, a domain was created to limit map class names to this list. The domain was altered as a few additional map classes were identified. Topology was established to enforce rules for no gaps or overlaps. All areas within the park boundary were mapped and mapping was usually extended somewhat beyond the boundary to insure complete coverage. A few changes were made to the vegetation map after results of thematic accuracy assessment were received from North Carolina State University. Aerial photo signatures of all misclassified accuracy assessment points were reviewed and polygons in the vegetation feature class were edited when appropriate. Most edits involved splitting polygons and reattributing the parts of the original polygon according to the correct classification determined by the accuracy assessment point. In a few cases the entire original polygon was reattributed or comments were added to indicate gradation or inclusions within the polygon. Comments were added to all edited polygons to indicate they were edited post accuracy assessment. The GARIvegetation feature class was clipped by the boundary for Gauley River National Recreation Area then all multipart polygons were converted to single part polygons. Kilometers and acres were calculated using XTools.</procdesc>
