      <abstract>The plot point displays the 97 field plot and observation points visited in 2003 &amp; 2004 as part of the vegetation mapping project. Sample plots were located subjectively in representative vegetation throughout the park. Field crews decided where and when to use observation points or vegetation plots to sample the vegetation. Vegetation plots were placed in stands judged by field crews to represent legitimate vegetation types that could be classified to the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) system using standard multivariate analysis techniques. Observation points were placed in stands (1) if the vegetation was highly altered and therefore not classifiable, (2) to provide information about the distribution of common vegetation types adequately sampled in vegetation plots, or (3) if the stand represented a unique vegetation type that was too small to hold a 400m2 sample plot (e.g., seeps, Hanging Gardens). The points were originally GPSed (using recreational GPS units), coordinates noted on the field sheets and then typed into the database.

The AA point displays the 288 accuracy assessment (AA) points visited in the fall of 2004 as part of the vegetation mapping project. The points were randomly selected, stratified by the map units used for vegetation mapping and further screened so as not to fall on inaccessible isolated mesa tops and vertical canyon walls. The coordinates were uploaded to Garmin hand-held GPS receivers so that ecologists could navigate to them in the field. Some AA points fell on ecotones and two sets of data were recorded on the evenly-split site. AA points that fell along polygon edges sometimes did not represent the entire polygon well and some AA points fell on small patches of vegetation that were different than the community in the larger area.</abstract>
      <purpose>Plots were collected to characterize the vegetation at Natural Bridges National Monument. These points show the location of plot and observation points visited, while accuracy assessment plots were visited to verify the mappers? interpretation of the vegetation communities. The intended use of all data in the park's GIS library is to support diverse park activities including planning, management, maintenance, research, and interpretation.</purpose>
