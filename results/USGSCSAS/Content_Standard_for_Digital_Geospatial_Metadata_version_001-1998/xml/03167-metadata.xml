      <abstract>The geographic information system (GIS) format spatial data set of vegetation for Buffalo National River (BUFF) was created for the National Park Service (NPS) Vegetation Inventory Program (VIP). The BUFF administrative boundary covers an area of nearly 38,000 ha. The map classification scheme used to create the vegetation data set is designed to represent local vegetation types at the finest level possible using the National Vegetation Classification Standard (NVCS) Version 2. Physiognomic information was also recorded, including height (woody vegetation), canopy density, and coverage patterns. The vegetation data set was developed by interpreting aerial photographs collected in October of 2006 and extensive field surveys. Individuals who cooperated in this project include; National Park Service (NPS) Vegetation Inventory Program, NPS BUFF, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Upper Midwest Environmental Science Center (UMESC), USGS Mid-Continent Geographic Science Center (MCGSC), NatureServe, and the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission (ANHC). The vegetation data are distributed as a polygon feature class in the geodatabase for the project, stored in Universal Transverse Mercator zone 15 mapping coordinates, North American Datum 1983.</abstract>
      <purpose>The NPS VIP is an effort to classify, describe, and map existing vegetation of national park units. Managed by the NPS Biological Resources Management Division, the NPS VIP provides baseline vegetation information for the NPS Natural Resource I&amp;M Program. The USGS Vegetation Characterization Program lends a cooperative role in the NPS VIP and serves the data sets on the Internet. Vegetation layers and associated information support a wide variety of resource assessment, park management, and planning needs. They also provide structure for framing and answering critical scientific questions about vegetation communities and their relation to environmental processes across the landscape.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Based on a thematic AA study that was conducted of map classes representing floristic types in the NVCS, the vegetation map of the Buffalo National River has an overall attribute accuracy of 78.9% (Kappa index of 77.3%); calculated using field data collected at 889 accuracy assessment observation sites. Most individual map-class themes exceed the NPS VIP standard of 80% with a 90% confidence interval. The project report provides details pertaining to the methods of the accuracy assessment study and the results from the analysis.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>All polygon features were checked for potential topology and attribute errors using the software program ArcGIS (9.3). Topology checks were performed to make sure each polygon was closed, no dangling features were present, each polygon contained a labeling point, and to make sure that no duplicate lines, polygons, or labels were present.</logic>
    <complete>All features identified by the photointerpreters were georeferenced. Map-code information produced by the photointerpreters (e.g., vegetation type, vegetation cover) is stored in the attribute table of the data set and in a series of lookup tables. The map codes are cross-referenced to the NVCS (Vr2) at all physiognomic and floristic levels. The NPS VIP standard minimum mapping unit (MMU) of 0.5 ha (1.24 acres) was applied for mapping. For select map classes, we applied a MMU of 0.25 ha to address management preferences. Also, when vegetation types were found unique to their immediate surroundings (e.g., a rocky open-canopy pine woodland within a closed-canopy oak forest), we allowed for mapping below the MMU. A set of MMU templates were used to help photointerpreters determine minimum polygon size during the interpretative process. Because of angle distortions inherent to nonrectified aerial photos, and slight scale changes from high ridges to valley bottoms, the MMU was applied liberally.</complete>

NED 1/3 Arc Second is designed to provide National elevation data in a seamless form with a consistent datum, elevation unit, and projection. Data corrections are made in the NED 1/3 Arc Second assembly process to minimize, but not eliminate, artifacts, perform edge matching, and fill sliver areas of missing data. NED 1/3 Arc Second has a resolution of 1/3 arc-second (approximately 10 meters) for the conterminous United States.</othercit>

        <procdesc>Map Classification: The ultimate goal of the map classification was to represent the vegetation types of BUFF as determined by the vegetation classifiers (NatureServe). The photointerpreters cooperated with the vegetation specialists to determine which vegetation types and communities could be accurately identified using the aerial photographs. Some of the classes appearing in the final vegetation map might be comprised of a single vegetation type as identified by the vegetation classifiers, and others may contain one of several different types. Not all vegetation types visible on the ground are identifiable in an aerial photograph.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Creation of the Geodatabase: The attribute table of the initial GIS format vegetation map contained only the map attribute codes that were assigned by the photointerpreters. To make these data more meaningful, a series of lookup tables were created, which contained items such as the map class names, physiognomic information (woody plant heights, area of coverage, distribution patterns), and all NVCS Vr2 hierarchy codes and nomenclature (when known and applicable), including the finest floristic level of the hierarchy, association. An ESRI format File Geodatabase was created to hold these data, as well as the vegetation plot data that were collected for developing the vegetation classification and for the accuracy assessment of the vegetation map, the project boundary extent, and aerial photograph information. A series of relationship class files were added to the file geodatabase, to make it easier for users to associate the lookup tables with the GIS datasets.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Preliminary Map Classification and Field Reconnaissance: Prior to field reconnaissance, mappers (UMESC) met with vegetation classifiers (NatureServe) to discuss the vegetation classification and how vegetation types might best be represented in a workable map classification. This built a working draft of the map classification to be used during field visits by the mappers. Before photointerpretation was initiated, photointerpreters made several visits to BUFF to perform field reconnaissance. Field visits were performed to a variety of locations within the BUFF Printed copies of the aerial photos that would be used during the photointerpretation process were brought along so conditions on the ground could be compared to images contained in the photos. These trips helped the photointerpreters further establish the map classification, determine what vegetation types could be identified within the aerial photos, and establish mapping convention on how best to apply the mapping of the vegetation types. These field efforts were conducted during 2009.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Vegetation Mapping: The vegetation mapping of the BUFF was performed at the UMESC via digital-onscreen three-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic workflow systems using GIS software. The mapping team performed onscreen photointerpretation of digital imagery that was spatially referenced in GIS.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Accuracy Assessment: An in-depth accuracy project was performed on the geographic information system (GIS) format vegetation polygon data set (vegetation map). This was done to measure the probability of map accuracy (or, the absence of error). A series of computer selected random sampling sites were chosen for each map class in the data set. The mapping coordinates of these sites were then provided to field crews, who used global positioning system (GPS) receivers to locate each site. The field data and calls at each of these sites were compared to polygon data and calls made by the photointerpreters to determine the thematic accuracy of the vegetation map. Detailed information on how this assessment was performed and its results are available in the project report.</procdesc>
