    <logic>Link and node polygon topology is created using AutoDesk Land Desktop 2006. The data is then exported to ESRI shape file format and reprojected from it's native Autodesk coordinate system to NAD83 generic latitude and longitude, LL83.</logic>
    <complete>The data set is complete but subject to continual updates to reflect boundary amendments, legislation, and acquisitions, and improved processing techniques. Information contained in LRD's land ownership databases is updated nightly however tract polygons are posted to the NPS Data Store on a monthly basis. Users can ensure parcel polygons have up to date ownership attribution after the publication date by contacting your regional LRD office or downloading the Current_Tract_Ownership_Data file located on the NPS Data Store (https://irma.nps.gov/App/Reference/Search) in a dBase format. Please contact the data originator with any suggested corrections and updates. LRD's boundary polygons represent the current legislated boundary of a given NPS unit. NPS does not necessarily have full fee ownership or hold another interest (easement, right of way, etc.) in all parcels contained within this boundary. Equivalently NPS may own or have an interest in parcels outside the legislated boundary of a given unit. In order to obtain complete information about current NPS interests both inside and outside the units legislated boundary, LRD's tracts files should also be downloaded and used in conjunction with LRD's boundary files.</complete>

        <procdesc>All boundary and tract linework was COGO'd from the description in Fort Union National Monument deed 1. The linework was georeferenced using a USGS Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangle. The source coordinate system used in Autodesk Land Desktop is North American Datum 1983, New Mexico State Plane, East zone, US foot. The Autodesk line work is imported, edited, attributed, approved, and a link and node topology is developed both for the tract and boundary data layers according to the procedures described in the Land Acquisition Procedures Manual Chapter 5. The entire unit is created in a geographically contiguous model space and separate layouts representing each individual segment map are created. The tract and boundary data is then reprojected to North American Datum 1983 generic latitude &amp; longitude and exported from Autodesk to an ArcView shape file format in a single step.</procdesc>
