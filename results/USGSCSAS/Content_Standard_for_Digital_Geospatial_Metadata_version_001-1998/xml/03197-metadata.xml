      <abstract>High resolution vegetation polygons mapped by the National Park Service. This file represents the vegetation at Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) as interpreted from October 2001 1:12,000-scale aerial photography. This effort is a part of the National Vegetation Mapping Program of the National Park Service.</abstract>
      <purpose>Vegetation maps of National Parks and National Monuments were developed to support natural resources management, planning, research and interpretation.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Data were imported to a file geodatabase by the Colorado Natural Heritage Program/Colorado State University. Parks had the flexibility to map vegetation down to the map class or to the association. Users of this particular dataset and all other datasets of the USGS-NPS Vegetation Monitoring Program Rocky Mountain National Park project are advised to read the report: "Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, 2001-2005 VEGETATION CLASSIFICATION AND MAPPING, Final Report - August, 2005, Technical Memorandum 8260-05-02, USBR/RSGIS". This report is available as either a single compiled PDF document, romorpt.pdf, or broken down as a series of PDF documents, and should have been included with these datasets. If not, request a copy from the contact listed in the Distribution_Information section of this metadata. It is the responsibility of any users of these data to actually READ the documentation.</supplinf>

      <attraccr>This project received an accuracy assessment in the summer of 2004. 1207 accuracy assessment points are recorded. The results were subject to a fuzzy accuracy assessment. Fuzzy accuracies are reported for overall map accuracy and individual map unit accuracy. Overall map accuracy for fuzzy classes five, four and three are 50.3%, 74.7% and 86.7%. We refer the reader to the vegetation mapping report for information about individual map unit accuracies and more specifics with regard to methods.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>All polygon features are checked for topology and existence of attributed label points. Coverage checked for un-intentional dangling arcs.</logic>
    <complete>All data with a minimum mapping unit of 1/2 hectare that can be interpreted from the aerial photographs are entered into the digital database. This includes features defined by the NVCS. Some classes under the MMU are included due to its ease of interpretation and due to the specialty of the class. Road and utility corridors and streams/canals wider that 10 meters are included as polygons in this vegetation coverage.</complete>

        <procdesc>MAP CLASSES: Vegetation classification was in accordance with the standards developed under the USGS/NPS Vegetation Mapping Program using the National Vegetation Classification Standard. Field work (collecting plot data) aided in the development of the vegetation classes. PHOTO INTERPRETATION: All map classes were interpreted from 1:12,000-scale, true color aerial photography. Photo-interpretation used the standard identification features such as tone, texture, color, pattern, topographic position, and shadow. In addition, field sample locations and their vegetation descriptions aided in assigning a map class to each polygon. Photographs were examined using a stereoscope as needed. Linework was created on mylars placed over both the aerial photos and the ortho-photos. The linework was subsequently transferred to a mylar overlaying the color 1:12,00 scale DOQ's acquired for this project. GIS PROCEDURES: The linework on the mylar ortho-photo overlays were transferred into the GIS database by scanning. METHOD : The all of the linework at ROMO was transferred via scanning the ortho-photo mylar overlays using a large-format color scanner. Before the mylar was scanned, it was marked with control points that correspond to the 1000-meter grid embossed on the hard-copy ortho-photos. GIS software was then used to convert the scanned files from a raster to vector base using centerline commands. Extensive cleaning, edge matching, and general editing of the digital vectors was completed before polygon topology was created. Labels were created for each polygon and they were attributed with the necessary vegetation information. The entire transfer and editing sequence was automated via in-house Arc/INFO AML programs. OTHER DATA: The park boundary coverages were acquired from the Park. A flight line coverage was obtained from the photography vendor.</procdesc>
