The Russian Arctic shelf acts as an estuary of the Great Siberian Rivers. This area has the highest documented rates of coastal sedimentation with annual accumulation rates of about 10x106 t C org year-, which approximately equals the amount of sediment accumulated over the entire pelagic zone of the World Ocean. Due to the specific features of sedimentation and lithogenesis in this area, much of this organic carbon survives decomposition, and is buried within seabed sediments. These sediments are annually ("offshore" permafrost) or seasonally frozen, representing a substantial reservoir of potentially labile organic carbon. Global warming in the Arctic region is predicted to be substantial, and possibly rapid, in next few decades. Upon permafrost melting, the old carbon stored therein will be reintroduced into the modern carbon biogeochemical cycle, possibly acting as a strong source of methane to the overlying water and potentially the atmosphere. Additionally, extremely large amounts of more ancient (Pleistocene) methane are trapped as gas hydrates within and beneath the permafrost. This project to elucidate the present and future methane flux potential of sediments and permafrost in regions of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. As a result of global warming, seafloor permafrost along the East Siberian Arctic Shelf may experience a pronounced change in thermal regime. Increased temperature may affect permafrost in several ways, ultimately leading to its degradation and enhanced CH4 release. This international, interdisciplinary research team determined the distribution and stability of permafrost on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf and evaluated this area as a methane source to the Arctic region. Cores from ten locations were obtained using dry drilling techniques.
Thermal and biogeochemical  data obtained from the boreholes/sediment cores were used as input to numerical models, which were developed to describe the thermodynamic and biogeochemical aspects of permafrost methane dynamics.
