<abstract>
<para>Quantitative comparisons of distribution and abundance of exotic species in their native and non-native ranges represent a first step when studying invaders. However, this approach is rarely applied &amp;#1113142; particularly to tree species. Using biogeo- graphical contrasts coupled with regional dispersal surveys, we assessed whether two exotic maple tree species, Acer negundo and Acer platanoides, can be classified as invasive in the non-native regions surveyed. We also examined the importance of biogeography in determining the degree of invasion by exotic species using this reciprocal approach. Local-scale surveys were conducted in a total of 34 forests to compare density, relative abundance, age structure of native and introduced populations, and whether the two introduced maple species negatively affected native tree species density. Regional-scale surveys of a total of 136 forests were then conducted to assess distribution in the introduced regions. Introduced popula- tions of A. negundo were denser than populations measured in their native range and negatively related to native tree species density. Age structure did not differ between regions for this species. At the regional scale, this species has invaded most of the riparian corridors sampled in France. Conversely, the density of A. platanoides introduced populations was similar to that of native populations and was not related to native tree species density. Although seedling recruitment was higher away than at home, this species has invaded only 9% of the forests sampled in southern Ontario, Canada. Although reported invasive, these two exotic maple species differed in their relative demographic parameters and regional spread. Acer negundo is currently invasive in southern France while A. platanoides is not aggressively invasive in southern Ontario. Importantly, this study effectively demonstrates that biogeography through structured contrasts provide a direct means to infer invasion of exotic species.</para>

<samplingDescription>
<para>Spatially-structured density surveys were conducted in both native and non-native ranges for each maple tree species. In total, 20 forests were surveyed in southern Ontario, Canada and 14 in southern France (Supplementary material Appendix 1, Table A1, A2). Within each forest, population densities were estimated not only for the introduced maple tree species but also for the native tree species occurring in the non-native range recipient communities. Acer negundo populations were sampled in 16 forests in Canada and 7 in France and Acer platanoides populations in 10 forests in Canada and 7 in France.
All the population densities were estimated with the same T-square method, a plotless density estimator based on tree-to-nearest-tree measurements (Byth 1982). Specifically, introduced and native tree stem densities were assessed using 600 m transects with regular sampling at 3 m intervals. Both the distance from the transect to the nearest target tree species and the distance from that individual to its closest neighbour were recorded at each interval (Krebs 1999, Steinke and Hennenberg 2006). This distance-based sampling technique provides an accurate estimate of both density and degree of spatial aggregation (Steinke and Hennenberg 2006). Moreover, the life-stage of each stem sampled was also recorded as seedlings (&amp;#1113143; 0.5 m in height), juveniles (&amp;#1113144;0.5 m but &amp;#1113143;3 m) or reproductively mature adults (&amp;#1113144; 3 m).</para>
