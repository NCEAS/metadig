<abstract>
<para>The dataset includes information on individual Eriogonum longifolium var. gnaphalifolium (scrub buckwheat)plants from six populations of E. l. gnaphalifolium in four burn units at Archbold Biological Station, located on the Lake Wales Ridge in central Florida.  We used permanent 10m x 10m plots and marked all E. l. gnaphalifolium plants within each plot with flags and numbered metal tags and censused them annually in summer.  One population was not burned during this time, three were burned once, and one each were burned three and four times. Plant survival and size measurements were taken annually. As plants can remain alive but dormant for several years, we continued to check the status of plants each year, even if it had not been seen recently.</para>

<title>Demography of Eriogonum longifolium var. gnaphalifolium</title>
<para>Within each population, we established between four and fourteen permanent 10m x 10m plots.  We marked all E. l. gnaphalifolium plants within each plot with flags and numbered metal tags and censused them annually.  A total of 1,114 plants were counted as alive at some point between 1989 and 1999.  One population was not burned during this time, three were burned once, and one each were burned three and four times.  These burns followed a schedule devised to benefit multiple species of concern at Archbold Biological Station, and the fire return intervals fell within the natural ranges for these habitats (Menges 1999).  There were no recorded burns in these areas between 1927 and 1989.

At each annual census, we monitored all plants for survival, total basal diameter (summed across all rosettes), and number of flowering scapes.  If we did not find a plant adjacent to an old flag, the plant was recorded as dead, but we did not remove the flag and we checked the area surrounding the flag for scrub buckwheat plants in subsequent years.  We searched each plot for new plants every year and every plant found was flagged, tagged, and followed in subsequent censuses.</para>

<para>Study Sites
	In July of 1989, we began monitoring six populations of E. l. gnaphalifolium in four burn units at Archbold Biological Station, located on the Lake Wales Ridge in central Florida (27&#176;11'N lat., 81&#176;21'W long.).  These populations occur in areas characterized as the turkey oak phase or the hickory phase of southern ridge sandhill (Abrahamson et al. 1984).  Within each population, we established between four and fourteen permanent 10m x 10m plots.  We marked all E. l. gnaphalifolium plants within each plot with flags and numbered metal tags and censused them annually.  A total of 1,114 plants were counted as alive at some point between 1989 and 1999.  One population was not burned during this time, three were burned once, and one each were burned three and four times.  These burns followed a schedule devised to benefit multiple species of concern at Archbold Biological Station, and the fire return intervals fell within the natural ranges for these habitats (Menges 1999).  There were no recorded burns in these areas between 1927 and 1989.</para>
