    <abstract>
      <para>The ECHAM climate model has been developed from the ECMWF
        atmospheric model (therefore the first part of its name: EC) and
        a comprehensive parameterisation package developed at Hamburg
        therefore the abbreviation HAM) which allows the model to be
        used for climate simulations. The model is a spectral transform
        model with 19 atmospheric layers and the results used here
        derive from experiments performed with spatial resolution T42
        (which approximates to about 2.8 degrees  longitude/latitude
        resolution). The model has also been used at resolutions in the
        range T21 to T106.  ECHAM4 is the current generation in the line
        of ECHAM models (Roeckner, et al., 1992). A summary of
        developments regarding model physics in ECHAM4 and a description
        of the simulated climate obtained with the uncoupled ECHAM4
        model is given in Roeckner et al. (1996). The initial sea
        surface temperature and sea-ice data is the COLA/CAC AMIP SST
        and sea-ice data set. The mean terrain heights are computed from
        high resolution US Navy data set. The fraction of grid area
        covered by vegetation based on the Wilson and Henderson-Sellers
        (1985) data set. The ocean albedo is a function of solar zenith
        angle and the land albedo from the satellite data of Geleyn and
        Preuss (1983). A diurnal cycle and gravity wave-drag is
        included. The time-step of the model is 24 minutes, except for
        radiation which uses two hours.  The ocean model is an updated
        version of the isopycnal model (OPYC3) developed by Josef
        Oberhuber (Oberhuber, 1993) at the Max-Planck-Institute for
        Meteorology, Hamburg, Germany. The name OPYC is derived from
        Ocean and isoPYCnal co-ordinates.  The concept to use isopycnals
        as the vertical co-ordinate system for an OGCM is based on the
        observation that the interior ocean behaves as a rather
        conservative fluid. Even over long distances the origin of water
        masses can be traced back by considering the distribution of
        active or passive tracers. Treating the ocean as a conservative
        fluid fails in areas of significant turbulence activity such as
        the surface boundary layer. A surface mixed-layer is therefore
        coupled to the interior ocean in order to represent near-surface
        vertical mixing and to improve the response time-scales to
        atmospheric forcing which is controlled by the mixed-layer
        thickness. Since the model is designed for studies on large
        scales, a sea ice model with rheology is included and serves the
        purpose of de-coupling the ocean from extreme high-latitude
        winter conditions and promotes a realistic treatment of the
        salinity forcing due to melting or freezing sea ice.  The
        experiments from which results are used here are the 1000-year
        unforced control simulation using the coupled ECHAM4/OPYC3 model
        and then two climate change simulations. The greenhouse gas only
        forced experiment (referred to as GGa1) used historical
        greenhouse gas forcing from 1860 to 1990 followed by a 1 per
        cent annum increase in radiative forcing from 1990 to 2099. The
        greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol forced experiment (referred
        to as GSa1) used the GGa1 forcing, plus the negative forcing due
        to sulphate aerosols. This was represented by means of an
        increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local
        sulphate loading. The indirect effects of aerosols were not
        simulated. For 1860 to 1990 the historic sulphate aerosol
        forcing estimate was used and for 1990 to 2049 the aerosol
        forcing estimated for the IS92a emissions scenario. The GSa1
        experiment did not extend beyond 2049.  Fuller details of the
        ECHAM4/OPYC3 coupled model can be found at the DDC Yellow Pages.
        Several papers describe results using this version of the model
        - see Bacher et al. (1998), Oberhuber et al. (1998), Zhang et
        al. (1998).  The climate sensitivity of ECHAM4 is about 2.6
        degrees C.The A2 world consolidates into a series of roughly
        continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots.
        In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to
        reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing
        to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards ncreased
        investment in education and science and growth in economic
        productivity. Social and political structures diversify with
        some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced
        income inequality, while others move towards "lean"
        government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although
        some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control
        and maintaining local environmental amenities.</para>
      <para>Like B1, the B2 world is one of increased concern for
        environmental and social sustainability, but the character of
        this world differs substantially.  Education and welfare
        programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality
        and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about
        10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United
        Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at
        an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100
        the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion.
        International income differences decrease, although not as
        rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1).
        Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development
        of stronger community support networks.  Generally high
        educational levels promote both development and environmental
        protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few
        remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to
        address global environmental challenges are less successful than
        in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing
        agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual
        economic benefits.  The B2 storyline presents a particularly
        favorable climate for community initiative and social
        innovation, especially in view of high educational levels.
        Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and
        innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally,
        investment in R and D continues its current declining trend, and
        mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and
        know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher
        than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic
        development and limited natural resources place particular
        emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation.
        Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of
        GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the
        average historical experience of the last two centuries.
        Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level
        in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a
        particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low
        level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on
        food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns
        towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in
        countries with high population densities.  Energy systems differ
        from region to region, depending on the availability of natural
        resources. The need to use energy and other resources more
        efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive
        technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at
        the regional level leads to success in the management of some
        transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due
        to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in
        agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in
        lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of
        elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy
        system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is
        a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil
        resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction
        in carbon intensity.</para>
