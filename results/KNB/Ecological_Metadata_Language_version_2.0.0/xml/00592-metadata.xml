    <abstract>
      <para>The CSIRO Atmospheric Research Mark 2b climate model (Hirst
        et al., 1996, 1999) has recently been used for a number of more
        sophisticated climate change simulations. These start from 1880
        to avoid the "cold start problem".  This version of
        the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in
        the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to
        earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global
        mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02
        degrees C/century. Note that the model uses flux correction.
        The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal
        resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees).
        The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21
        levels.  The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed
        layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the
        high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995,
        Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model
        combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into
        an "equivalent" CO2 concentration. Observed
        concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a
        projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year
        compounding increase of equivalent CO2.  Another model
        experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from
        atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is
        included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to
        the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995)
        and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are
        the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the
        chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a
        present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4
        W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas
        forcing of about 2 W/m^2.  The magnitude of the 20th century
        warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed
        reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing
        from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect
        effect and the effect of soot.  The climate sensitivity of
        CSIRO-Mk2 is about 4.3 degrees C (Watterson et al.,1997).</para>
      <para>Like B1, the B2 world is one of increased concern for
        environmental and social sustainability, but the character of
        this world differs substantially.  Education and welfare
        programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality
        and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about
        10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United
        Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at
        an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100
        the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion.
        International income differences decrease, although not as
        rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1).
        Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development
        of stronger community support networks.  Generally high
        educational levels promote both development and environmental
        protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few
        remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to
        address global environmental challenges are less successful than
        in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing
        agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual
        economic benefits.  The B2 storyline presents a particularly
        favorable climate for community initiative and social
        innovation, especially in view of high educational levels.
        Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and
        innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally,
        investment in R and D continues its current declining trend, and
        mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and
        know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher
        than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic
        development and limited natural resources place particular
        emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation.
        Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of
        GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the
        average historical experience of the last two centuries.
        Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level
        in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a
        particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low
        level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on
        food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns
        towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in
        countries with high population densities.  Energy systems differ
        from region to region, depending on the availability of natural
        resources. The need to use energy and other resources more
        efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive
        technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at
        the regional level leads to success in the management of some
        transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due
        to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in
        agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in
        lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of
        elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy
        system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is
        a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil
        resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction
        in carbon intensity.</para>
