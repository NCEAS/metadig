 <abstract><para>The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes dead standing litter data (1985-1989), collected as part of the decomposition section of MERP.
	The high primary productivity in wetlands ensures that plant litter production and decomposition are important factors in wetland nutrient budgets. There are 3 components of the litter pool in prairie wetlands: standing litter, fallen litter, and dissolved organic compounds that leach from both standing and fallen litter (Davis and van der Valk, 1978). Material enters the standing litter compartment with the death of the leaf or shoots. In prairie marshes, litter is transferred from the standing litter compartment to fallen litter primarily through fragmentation by wind, snow, and ice action. In areas of high muskrat activity, feeding and house building can result in living plant tissues directly entering the fallen litter stage. Once within the fallen litter compartment, decomposition rates increase due to the growth of bacteria, fungi, and other consumers on the litter particles. (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). 
	The MERP decomposition studies are a series of short-term studies examining the decomposition rates of both above- and belowground components of the dominant emergent species and the transfer of litter from the standing to the fallen litter compartment within the experimental cells (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Three types of decomposition studies were conducted: litterbag studies, dead standing litter (clip plot) studies and matching stems (permanent clips) studies. The purpose of this study was to estimate annual standing litter production by monitoring standing litter biomass and nutrient concentration. During both early May and August collections, &#8216;clip quadrats&#8217; of 1m x 1m were used to monitor standing crops of biomass, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon. In May collections, only aerial standing litter (dead) was sampled at dry and flooded sites. In August collections, aerial standing litter (dead, at dry and flooded sites), as well as aerial standing live shoots and flooded standing live shoots (at flooded sites) were sampled, keeping the flooded and aerial portions of a stem separate. The experimental time frame was May 1985 to August 1989 (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989).

 <para>Definitions:</para>
 <para>-All standing litter: on dry sites, all litter that is not lying horizontal on the ground (from the previous August).</para>
 <para>-Aerial standing litter: dead plants, in flooded sites, that are not toppled, i.e. a portion of a shoot which protrudes above the water surface (from the previous August).</para>
 <para>-Aerial standing live shoots: live plants, in flooded sites, that are not toppled, i.e. a portion of a shoot which protrudes above the water surface.</para>
 <para>-Flooded standing live shoots: live plants, in flooded sites, that are not toppled, i.e. a portion of a shoot which is completely submersed or laying on the water surface.</para>
 <para>The purpose of this study was to estimate annual standing litter production by monitoring standing litter biomass and nutrient concentration. During both early May and August collections, &#8216;clip quadrats&#8217; of 1m x 1m were used to monitor standing crops of biomass, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon. In May collections, only aerial standing litter (dead) was sampled at dry and flooded sites. In August collections, aerial standing litter (dead, at dry and flooded sites), as well as aerial standing live shoots and flooded standing live shoots (at flooded sites) were sampled, keeping the flooded and aerial portions of a stem separate. The experimental time frame was May 1985 to August 1989 (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989).</para>
 <para>Approximately 150 established research sites (15 sites per each of the 10 MERP cells) were utilized. The criteria for site selection was to represent the natural depth range for each species. New sites were selected when vegetation became sparse or void on previously selected sites. Each site was marked by a numbered stake. Sampling required that 1m x 1m quadrats be clipped at all sites. A randomly selected, undisturbed plot was located within 2 meters of the site marker stake. All clip data was recorded on the standing litter clip plot field sheets. Month of sampling and quadrat moisture condition (dry vs. flooded) determined the incumbent sampling schedule (with the exception of 1985; Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989).</para>
 <para>At each dry site, only dead standing shoots within the quadrat were clipped. As with aboveground macrophyte sampling (contained within a separate data package on the KNB), large hand clippers were used, clipping all standing dead shoots rooted within the quadrat. The same general procedure was followed at flooded sites, with the exception that water depth was recorded at the center of each quadrat, and both aerial and flooded portions of a shoot, as well as live and dead (depending on sampling month), were collected and kept separately. For both dry and flooded sites, if a plant was rooted within the quadrat, all foliage was included with the sample even if it extended beyond the quadrat bounds. Within a quadrat, all dominant emergent species (i.e. Typha glauca syn. Typha &#215; glauca, Phragmites australis, Carex atherodes, Scirpus validus syn. Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, Scirpus acutus syn. Schoenoplectus acutus, Scirpus maritimus, Scolochloa festucacea; for 1985, dominant species also included Aster brachyactis syn. Symphytotrichum ciliatum, Atriplex patula, Chenopodium rubrum and Sonchus arvensis), and any additional species with greater than 25% cover, were treated separately. Other species with less than 25% cover were combined and labeled &#8220;minor species&#8221;. After clipping, these sorted plants were placed into separate paper bags and labeled by 1) species name, 2) collection date, 3) site number, 4) cell, 5) moisture condition along with clip type (i.e. dry standing litter, aerial standing litter, aerial standing live shoots, flooded standing live shoots). Aerial standing litter (dead) was assumed to be from the previous year with the exception of Phragmites, which can persist for one or more years and therefore was separated as fresh litter (shiny; tan color) or old litter (dull; grey color; Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989).</para>
 <para>All litter samples were immediately dried to constant weight (80 degrees Celcius) in the drying room. If necessary, samples were stored in the cold room until space was available in the drying room. Once dried to constant weight (80 degrees Celcius), each sampled was placed in a paper bag and reweighed to 0.01g accuracy. Both weights were recorded on the standing litter clip plot field sheets. All dried samples were ground in a 40-mesh Wiley mill and each stored in Whirlpak bags. A single sample which occupied more than one storage bag was subsampled at random from all storage bags, taking care to include plant parts in proportion to their relative biomass within the sample (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Clip quadrat samples were analyzed for nutrient (phosphorus, carbon and nitrogen) concentrations by Iowa State University. To reduce costs, only three samples from each species (Aster brachyactis syn. Symphytotrichum ciliatum, Chenopodium rubrum, Sonchus arvensis, Cirsium arvense, Atriplex patula, Mentha arvensis, Hordeum jubatum, Salix sp., Typha glauca syn. Typha &#215; glauca, Phragmites australis, Scolochloa festucacea, Scirpus maritimus, Scirpus validus, Carex atherodes) and litter type (aerial and dead samples for spring 1985, fall 1985 and spring 1986, as well as aerial and live, aerial and dead, flooded and live, and flooded and dead for fall 1986) combination were randomly selected for nutrient analysis, and only from the 1985-1986 sampling period.</para>

 <para>Introduction</para>
 <para>Good et al. (1978) and Greeson et al. (1978) were among the first to summarize the state of our understanding in freshwater wetland ecology. They emphasized the need for expanded interdisciplinary research in freshwater wetlands. Ten years later, van der Valk (1989), in Northern Prairie Wetlands, focused specifically on prairie wetlands and the influence of water-level changes on the dynamics and productivity of these systems.</para>
 <para>Primary production, secondary production, vegetation composition and distribution, animal use, and nutrient budgets are all affected as water levels rise and fall with variation in precipitation. Ranging from tiny potholes to huge lacustrine complexes, prairie wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems (Murkin, 1989a). Their importance as wildlife production areas has drawn considerable attention to their conservation and management (Weller, 1978; Weller, 1981). This attention has increased in recent years with the need for information on the overall functions and values of wetlands within the prairie landscape (Murkin, 1998). Understanding wetland values is critical to the development of comprehensive wetland conservation programs. In addition, the ongoing destruction of wetlands through drainage, urban sprawl, and other human-induced changes has added a great deal of urgency to the need for a better understanding of the ecology and management of all remaining wetland areas (Murkin et al., 2000a).</para>
 <para>Objectives</para>
 <para>Recognizing the need for an improved understanding of prairie wetland ecology, the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was initiated in 1979 as a joint project of</para>
 <para>Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station (Murkin et al., 1984). The MERP was designed as a long-term replicated experiment addressing the impacts of various water levels on the main components of the prairie wetland ecosystem. The overall objective of MERP was to document the changes that occur within a prairie wetland during a simulated wet-dry cycle (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). More specifically, MERP was designed to determine the storage (pools) and movement (fluxes) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) during the various stages of the cycle (Murkin et al., 2000a). Specific objectives for each of the major ecosystem components were as follows:</para>
 <para>1. Hydrology: to estimate the terms of the water budget during all stages of the wet-dry cycle: surface water in and out, ground water in and out, change in storage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration.</para>
 <para>2. Water chemistry: to estimate the concentrations of N, P, C, and major ions in both surface and substrate pore-water pools and to monitor changes in these pools during the wet-dry cycle.</para>
 <para>3. Macrophytes: to estimate annual above- and below ground macrophyte productivity and standing crops and subsequent changes related to the wet-dry cycle. Storage and movement of N, P, and C in macrophytes during the wet-dry cycle also were determined.</para>
 <para>4. Macrophyte litter: to estimate the annual production of above- and belowground macrophyte litter and the loss and uptake of N, P, and C to and from the litter compartment.</para>
 <para>5. Algae: to estimate algal standing crops and productivity (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon, and metaphyton) during the various stages of the wet-dry cycle.</para>
 <para>6. Invertebrates: to estimate standing crops of invertebrates (nekton, benthos, and emerging insects) during the various phases of the wet-dry cycle.</para>
 <para>7. Vertebrates: to monitor use by waterfowl, coots, blackbirds, and muskrats in response to habitat changes during the wet- dry cycle.</para>
 <para>The MERP experimental design and field-sampling protocols were developed to meet these objectives. Nutrient data were used to construct nutrient budgets for the experimental cells. Several additional objectives beyond those related specifically to nutrient storage and movement also were addressed. Examples are rate of recovery of plant communities following drawdown (Welling et al., 1988a), habitat use by various vertebrate groups during specific stages of the wet-dry cycle (Clark and Kroeker, 1993), and the effect of the wet-dry cycle on individual invertebrate species (Ross and Murkin, 1993; Murkin et al., 2000a).</para>
 <para>Study Area</para>
 <para>The MERP study area was located on the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba, Canada (50&#61616;11'N, 98&#176;19'W). The Delta Marsh is a large lacustrine marsh (&#61627;15,000 ha) along the southern shore of Lake Manitoba (see Batt, 2000). The marsh is of Pleistocene origin and is a remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz (L&#246;ve and L&#246;ve, 1954, Ehrlich et al., 1957). An important feature of the marsh is that its water level has been stabilized for many years (due to installation of a water-control structure on Lake Manitoba in 1961), resulting in lake marsh conditions described by van der Valk and Davis (1978) over much of its area (Murkin et al., 2000a). The site for the MERP experimental complex was chosen because of several features. First, the area had representative portions of shallow- and deep-marsh zones characteristic of the Delta Marsh and other northern prairie marshes. Second, the area was remote and completely within the private ownership of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station, thus ensuring access for researchers, while affording effective control of trespass and disturbance. Third, the site was served by an existing road system. This road system was crucial, given the large number of individuals working on the site each day; the large numbers and volumes of water, soil, vegetation, and animal samples to be handled; and the logistics of transporting and maintaining sampling devices. Finally, the existing road provided the northern boundary of the experimental cells, thereby reducing construction costs. The water levels used in the experiments were chosen to reflect conditions that had occurred naturally during the previous 5 decades. Thus, the experimental site and design has provided information that is relevant to any future management efforts on the Delta Marsh, specifically, and wetland management in general.</para>
 <para>The experimental cell complex consisted of 10 contiguous 4-6 ha marsh units (Cells 1-10), created in 1979 by building a series of dikes along the northern edge of the main marsh. The diked experimental cells were numbered 1 to 10 from west to east. The approximate dimension of each diked cell was 150m x 300m (see Table 1 for the specific dimensions of each cell). Disturbance due to dike construction was confined to the dikes and a 10m buffer strip on each side of the dike. Each diked cell was equipped with a water control structure and electric pump with automatic controls to adjust and maintain (&#61617;2cm) water levels according to the schedule (see Table 2). Besides the diked cells, two undiked areas of similar size within the Delta Marsh (Cells 11 &amp; 12) were monitored as reference cells (i.e. reference cells to the unmanipulated Delta Marsh). The vegetation within the diked cells prior to the experimental treatments was comparable to the reference cells and main Delta Marsh (Pederson 1981; Murkin et al., 2000a).</para>
 <para>Experimental Design</para>
 <para>The general MERP objective was to monitor the response of various aspects of the wetland ecosystem to a series of water-level manipulations intended to simulate the wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands. The schedule for water-level treatments and the number of replicates for each treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The study was basically divided into four phases. The first two phases (baseline and deep flooding) were designed to provide background information on the experimental cells and to bring all cells to a similar condition (lake marsh stage) before the actual wet-dry cycle was applied during the last two phases (drawdown and reflooding; Murkin et al., 2000a). The four phases of the experimental design were as follows:</para>
 <para>a.	Baseline year (1980-1981):</para>
 <para>During the first year of the study (1980), the control structures were left open and water levels within the cells were allowed to track the levels of the Delta Marsh. This method provided a year of baseline data before the actual water-level manipulations began. Two of the cells (3 and 7) were kept at baseline levels for a second year (1981) to allow for comparison of different durations of drawdown later in the study (see Table 3).</para>
 <para>b.	Deep flooding (aka Conditioning Period; 1981-1983):</para>
 <para>Following the baseline year(s), all diked cells were flooded to ~ 1 m above normal for a period of 2 years (Table 2). These levels were designed to flood the existing cattail (Typha spp.) stands to a depth of 1 m and were similar to actual natural high-water levels that occurred in the Delta Marsh in the 1950s. This deep flooding was intended to kill the existing emergent vegetation and set all the cells to the lake marsh stage described by van der Valk and Davis (1978). In part, deep flooding was also an attempt to reduce the variability in vegetation among the experimental cells prior to drawdown.</para>
 <para>c.	Drawdown (1983-1984):</para>
 <para>After the second year of above-normal flooding, the cells were drawn down (completely dewatered) by adjusting the water levels to 50 cm below the long-term level of the Delta Marsh (Table 2). Most cells were exposed to a 2-year drawdown. Two cells (3 and 7) were drawn down for 1 year to allow comparisons between drawdowns of 1- and 2-year durations. The drawdowns allowed vegetation to reestablish on the marsh substrates (Welling et al., 1988a, b).</para>
 <para>d.	Reflooding (1985-1989):</para>
 <para>It has been assumed that the rate at which prairie wetlands proceed through the various stages of the wet-dry cycle is determined by water depth, with deeper wetlands moving to the lake marsh stage more quickly than shallowly flooded wetlands (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). Following drawdown, the cells were reflooded to three different levels (Table 3). The normal level was the long-term mean level (247.50 m above mean sea level [AMSL]) of the Delta Marsh and the medium (247.80 m) and high (248.10 m) levels were 30 and 60 cm above the long-term mean, respectively (Murkin et al., 2000a).</para>
 <para>To ensure replicated treatments (on a hydrologic basis) during the reflooding experiments in 1985-1989, water-level treatments were assigned to the experimental cells as follows: the two low-water treatments with a 1-year drawdown (Table 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental complex, and the remaining treatments were then assigned to the other cells to ensure that each cell within a water-level treatment had a similar hydrologic setting (i.e. both low cells with 1-year drawdowns were flanked by cells with low and high treatments, both low 2-year drawdown cells by low and medium treatments, all medium treatment cells by high- and low-treatment cells, and the high-treatment cells by medium and low cells). This replicated hydrology is discussed in more detail in Kadlec (1983, 1993). The treatment assignments for the 1985-1989 period (Table 3) determined the water-level assignments during the early phases of the MERP experiments from 1981 to 1984 (Table 2).</para>
 <para>Long-term Monitoring Program</para>
 <para>The Scientific Team designed a program of standardized methods to monitor the experimental cells throughout the period of study. The basic strategy was to collect a comparable data set from year to year in each experimental cell for each of the major components being monitored, including hydrology, water chemistry, macrophytes, macrophyte litter, algae, invertebrates and vertebrates (Murkin et al., 2000a; Murkin, 1989b). The MERP long-term monitoring program involved a variety of techniques that were used to provide comparable datasets across the experimental cells and over the 10 years of fieldwork. Some of the techniques used were new, but most were adopted from other researchers. All have been modified to suit the needs for efficiency, economy and practicality for long-term large-scale ecosystem research (Murkin et al., 2000b). Each component has a section in the MERP Data Archive describing the techniques used.</para>
 <para>Short-term Studies</para>
 <para>Besides the long-term monitoring program, short-term studies were an integral component of the overall MERP program. Some of these studies provided background information needed to develop the long-term monitoring program (Pederson, 1981; Wrubleski, 1984). Some were integrated into the long-term monitoring program (Murkin, 1983a; Galinato, 1985; Hosseini, 1986; Welling, 1987; Merendino, 1989). Several aspects of the long-term monitoring program following drawdown began as short-term studies (Kroeker, 1988; Squires, 1991; Wrubleksi, 1991). Many of the short-term studies, however, were initiated because of questions raised by the long-term monitoring program. This approach was particularly true for studies of invertebrates (Nelson, 1982; Neckles, 1984; Bicknese, 1987; Campeau, 1990) and emergent macrophytes (Neill, 1988; Neill, 1992). Many of the short-term studies were conducted by graduate studies, a list of which can be found in merp_pubs_appx3_prairie_wetland_ecology_pdfa.pdf and whose theses can be found in the merp_publications_theses file (Murkin et al., 2000a).</para>
 <para>Main Transects, Work Lanes and Sampling Procedure</para>
 <para>To aid in the assignment of sampling stations, each cell was divided into 10 zones. Zone boundaries were parallel to the southern dike. To determine the zones, 10 areas of equal width were established between a line 10 m north of the south dike and a second line 10 m south of the road on the northern edge of the cell. These zones were permanently marked so they could be located from year to year.</para>
 <para>Each year, ten transects were randomly established within each cell, 1 per zone, numbered from north to south. These transects or &#8216;work lanes&#8217; were used for all types of routine sampling, in order to minimize disturbance and confine it within a designated region. All sampling took place as near as possible to the work lane. When a sampling point was some distance from the work lane, a path perpendicular to the work lane was established. Work lanes were reassigned each fall following the last day of sampling (Murkin, 1989b; Murkin et al., 2000b).</para>
 <para>A standard sampling procedure was maintained during all transect sampling. One or two random transects in each cell were sampled, repeating the same method for each cell until all samples were secured, rather than sampling all transects in a cell before moving on to the next cell. This randomized any effect due to time during the sampling period. As standard procedure, water depth at the sampling site was recorded during all types of sampling (Murkin, 1983b).</para>

1985: 1-150
1986: 1-180 (1-189 fall 1986)
1987: 1-187 (1-215 fall 1987)
1988: 3-215 (1-220 fall 1988)
1989: 1-220

Note: For an unknown reason, the number of sites sampled is reduced from ~150 (from 1985 to spring 1987), to ~60 (from fall 1987 to 1989). As the dead standing litter (1985-1989) data was never published, no reason can be given as to this change in methodology; however, the reduction in number of sites may have been to reduce the impact of sampling on the cells, or to reduce the workload.</attributeDefinition>

 <attribute id="1322086291359"><attributeName>h2o_depth</attributeName>
 <attributeLabel>water depth (cm)</attributeLabel>
 <attributeDefinition>water depth was recorded at the centre of each quadrat.
In addition to sampling month, water depth (i.e. dry vs. flooded) also determined the type of litter sampled (i.e. if dry = aerial standing litter, if flooded = aerial standing litter, aerial standing live shoots, aerial standing flooded shoots)
Note: Water depth data for Fall 1985 was only recorded on the fieldsheets as 'flooded', 'dry' or 'trace', and was therefore not included in the data file.</attributeDefinition>

2=flooded (i.e. plants that are not toppled and, if at flooded sites, completely submersed or laying on top of the water surface)
whether aerial or flooded shoots were sampled was determined according to the sampling month. If sampled in May, only aerial standing litter (1) was collected from dry and flooded sites. If sampled in August, aerial and flooded shoots were collected at flooded sites, as well as aerial standing litter from dry sites. The exception to this is 1985, where aerial and flooded litter was sampled in May, but only aerial litter sampled in August.</attributeDefinition>

Starting in 1986, whether live or dead shoots were sampled was determined according to the sampling month. If sampled in May, only aerial standing litter (i.e. dead) was collected from dry and flooded sites. If sampled in August, live and dead shoots (i.e. aerial standing litter, aerial standing live shoots and flooded standing live shoots) were collected from flooded sites, in addition to the collection of standing litter from dry sites (note that although the Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989 MERP procedures manual methods state that in August, only dead standing litter was collected at dry sites, the dataset also contains aerial standing live shoots at dry sites. It is unknown why this data is included, and whether or not there was a change in study design which was not recorded in the MERP procedures). In 1985, only dead shoots (aerial and flooded) were collected.</attributeDefinition>
