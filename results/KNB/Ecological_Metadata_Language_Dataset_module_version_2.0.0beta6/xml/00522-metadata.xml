Live and dead stems of each tree in a plot were measured (DBH). In addition, due to the recent infestations in both watersheds by the southern pine bark beetle, current status of trees was also noted: 1=healthy, 2=pitch tubes present but tree is still green, 3=slightly browning of needles, 4=brown needles, killed by pine bark beetle, 5=dead stem, and 6=presumably dead due to pine bark beetle.</paragraph></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>white pine</keyword><keywordThesaurus>none</keywordThesaurus></keywordSet><keywordSet><keyword>basal area</keyword><keywordThesaurus>none</keywordThesaurus></keywordSet><additionalInfo><paragraph>40 O.2 acre plots were established in 1967. DBHs of all white pines (live and dead stems) were recorded during the survey dates of 1967, 1969, 1972, 1984, and 1989. Measured trees were marked using paint during these sampling dates. The 2001 survey measured all trees (DBH) and marked the trees using a 3.5 inch aluminum nail. In addition, current status of the white pines was also noted using the following classes: 1=healthy, 2=pitch tubes present but tree is still green, 3=slightly browning of needles, 4=brown needles, killed by pine bark beetle, 5=dead stem, and 6=presumably dead due to pine bark beetle.</paragraph></additionalInfo><rights><paragraph>other</paragraph><paragraph>limited access</paragraph></rights><offlineMedium><medName>digital</medName></offlineMedium><onlineURL>http://coweeta.ecology.uga.edu/cgi-bin/forms/metadata/</onlineURL><triple><subject>obfs.303.2</subject><relationship>describes access control rules for</relationship><object>obfs.304.3</object></triple><triple><subject>obfs.303.2</subject><relationship>provides access control rules for</relationship><object>obfs.303.2</object></triple><temporalCov><rngdates><begdate>MAY2001</begdate><enddate>JUL2001</enddate></rngdates></temporalCov><geographicCov><descgeog /><bounding><westbc>-83.43</westbc><eastbc>0</eastbc><northbc>35.08</northbc><southbc>0</southbc></bounding></geographicCov></dataset>
